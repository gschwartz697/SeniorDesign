"	Hello! I've looked at the Piazza posts and even actually asked a private post about this but still can't fix the issue (although I think I now identified it).

I think the reason why my thickness toggle is also making the borders thick is because I change the thickness of the entire paint.thickness thick so that when we repaint, the borders all come out as thick. 

I am stuck on how to fix that issue, namely, how to just change the thickness of the things being drawn in the canvas and not the other widgets. (For some weird reason only my borders are being drawn that way.. probably because they are being drawn in paint.m;)  I've command'f ed all the places that color goes into and made sure that my thickness behaves the same. I also add new shapes to the deque with current thickness and draw them each with the correct thickness. I've been stuck on this for quite a while, but would it be possible to receive a bit of help to identify where I am making a mistake? It would help tremendously if someone could look at my code :( Sorry if it's a bit much I am asking. 

Thank You! "

"	Is this also a valid solution for 1e (the question above)?

let length (q: 'a ceque) : int =    begin match q.head with    | None -&gt; 0    | Some n -&gt;	 let rec loop (qno: 'a cqnode option) (acc: int) : int =		begin match qno with		| None -&gt; failwith ""invariants violated""		| Some m -&gt; if qno == n.prev then acc + 1			    else loop m.next (acc + 1)		end in	  loop q.head 0	end

Do we fill it out based on how many similarities each type of monkey (that wasn't used in tree greater_apes)  has with humans, where the two most similar would be a bottom of the tree, where humans and chimps are in greater_apes?	Yeah thanks! I asked because I'm confused on how to implement the simplest tree function if I can't store the simplest tree thus far in a variable. Is there a way to store and update a variable within a recursive function without it being overwritten every time?

Thank you 	This is the comment written before the printing of the simplest lesser apes tree:

""However, trying this out for lesser apes produces something close, but not * quite exactly what we wanted. Uncomment the printing commands below to see * how close we get.""

My greater apes tree matches the one from the problem but my lesser apes one doesn't. Does this comment mean that it's ok if our lesser apes tree doesn't exactly fit the lesser apes tree from figure A?	what does the tree in your example look like? would the node have two branching leaves and if so why do we not have to specify a value for it?	If the tree I printed out for greater apes is the exact mirror of Figure A, do I need to worry anything about it? They feel identical to me. 	But then in problem 7, didn’t the lesser apes tree show that the smallest difference didn’t necessarily lead to the expected result? 	I have all my tests passed for problem 1 to 7.

When I tried to use it in treeSet.ml, so as to not repeat code, it did not work (resulting in an infinite loop). Is this because the function was not listed in tree.mli?
