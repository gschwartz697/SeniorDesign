I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

Would it be appropriate to understand the references as sort of a mutable local variable in Java?

And would I just be mutating the references to store different information?

I see the implementation as pretty challenging too as it might require two value controllers (one for which option in the menu is chosen and another for whether the menu is open or not) and I would also have to consider the situation when the drop-down is \"above\" some other features, so I'll attempt radio buttons and sliders first and then implement this if I have time. \n",

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

      "> 19.744396\tI'm changing this to private because it is about my specific implementation.

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",
