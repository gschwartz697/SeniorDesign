<p>BFS2:<br />This is the class that contains the BFS algorithm. The key here is that I used an array to store the discovered<br />nodes.

<p>QUESTION 4-----------------------<br />4a) The shortest path from 40 to 1050 is 3<br />4b) The graph is connected: true<br />This is because in the array containing all nodes, every node was discovered by the BFS algorithm.<br />If it werent connected then there would be no neighbors in a connected component to reach every single<br />node such that all the nodes were discovered in the end.<br />4c) the maximum frontiers to reach all nodes is: 8, 6 and 7 <br />The reason why we get different numbers is that we are starting at different nodes which may have different<br />shortest paths to different respective nodes. <br />4d) The number of nodes 4 or less frontiers from 1344 is: 3780</p>

Otherwise,this algorithm operates exactly as described in class where we had a queue that we keep iterating through untilempty and then adding nodes to the discovered list and setting their respective frontiers.
DFS:Origionally I tried using a stack for this algorithm where I would pop the stack when a Node has no moreundiscovered neighbors. The key that made my implementation so efficient was that I used recursion which accomplished the same effect as a stack except that popping happened automatically as the nature of recursion.
QUESTION 4-----------------------4a) The shortest path from 40 to 1050 is 34b) The graph is connected: trueThis is because in the array containing all nodes, every node was discovered by the BFS algorithm.If it werent connected then there would be no neighbors in a connected component to reach every singlenode such that all the nodes were discovered in the end.4c) the maximum frontiers to reach all nodes is: 8, 6 and 7 The reason why we get different numbers is that we are starting at different nodes which may have differentshortest paths to different respective nodes. 4d) The number of nodes 4 or less frontiers from 1344 is: 3780

The US government ranks the ENIAC programmers as one of the top 20 events in history that exemplify the untold stories of women in technology (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/women-in-stem) - and it happened right in our backyard! Right next to those snack-munching late nighters and last-minute submissions in Moore.We’ll have popcorn for the documentary and fancy reception food (courtesy of the CIS department)! Professor Marcus, who is very knowledgeable about the ENIAC and has even met some of the women ENIAC programmers in person, will also be hosting an exciting talk! The screening and talk will be in Wu and Chen Auditorium, but in addition, we’ll also have the documentary playing throughout the day in Levine Lobby so feel free to just drop by during that awkward gap between your classes for a 20 minute refresher! See here for some backstory:
As part of a secret World War Two project, six young women programmed the first all-electronic programmable computer. However, when the project was eventually introduced to the public in 1946, the women were never credited for their work. Nor were they identified or their names labelled in any following photographs of the team with the ENIAC. Nor were they invited to the first celebration dinner. Their story was lost for half a century - and it’s time to uncover it!Please check out our facebook event and mark ""going"" if you are available: https://www.facebook.com/events/214695645747105/
For more information on the documentary, feel free to check out http://eniacprogrammers.org/Also if you want to see how Penn has been called out for this, feel free to check out http://eniacprogrammers.org/the-70th-anniversary/

I've been collecting what summer projects are available from all the faculty and here's what I have so far:

===
Mayur Naik - mhnaik@seas.upenn.eduI am happy to supervise CIS undergrads who have taken some combination of CIS 120, 121, 160, 262 and done well. They must be good at programming and, as a bonus, in theory/algorithms. Here's more information about research projects in my group: http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/phd_visit_day_naik.pptx . Any of the below choices (pay, REU, etc.) is fine.

===Mark Liberman - markyliberman@gmail.com
(1) Transcription, annotation and analysis of ~10k hours of neuropsychological examinations, in collaboration with the Framingham Heart Study. The aims:
Aim 1: Generate ""gold standard"" transcripts of 8000+ existing voice recordings as well as those being acquired through on-going neuropsy. testing of all FHS cohorts. Aim 2: Analysis of the 8000+ existing voice recordings obtained between 2005-present using existing voice recognition and voice analysis software. Aim 3: Build additional software to analyze the digital voice signals and generate novel cognitive metrics from latency and other behavioral characteristics. Aim 4: For each neuropsychological tests as well as across tests, identify normative values for e-voice metrics stratified by age, education, sex, both individually and in combination (e.g., age x education; age x sex; age x education x sex) Aim 5: Conduct factor and cluster analysis of e-cognitive metrics across neuropsychological tests to identify domain specific measures. Aim 6: Determine e-voice metrics/profiles that differentiate between those with and without known AD risk factors, including but not limited to, ApoE, family history of dementia/AD, homocysteine, vascular risk factors (including metabolic), inflammatory markers. Aim 7: Determine whether neuroimaging biomarkers are related to e-voice metrics/profiles. Aim 8: Determine whether incident change in neuroimaging biomarkers and neuropsychological tests are related to e-cognitive profiles. Aim 9: Determine whether e-voice metrics/profiles can differentiate participants who are low to high risk for dementia/AD. Aim 10: Conduct data driven analyses to identify e-voice metrics/profiles predictive of AD endophenotypes and risk for dementia/AD, in isolation and in combination with other health, lifestyle, biomarkers and genetic risk factors.
Everyone will start out on segmentation and transcription of (a sample of) the recordings, using software and procedures that you'll be trained on. We'll then be developing ways to automate stages of the process via machine-learning procedures, compile relevant measurements, and to analyze the results. A team of researchers and student workers is already set up for this project, but we're interested in recruiting additional participants.
(2) Analysis of student writing, peer and instructor evaluations, and the evolution of drafts, in collaboration with Penn's Critical Writing program. One or two summer positions will be available.
Both projects pay $13/hour to start.

2018 Research Topics include:

Norman Badler
Repopulating and interactively experiencing prehistoric sites will be a significant focus of Badler's summer project. Over the past decade I have co-taught an undergraduate course with Dr. Clark Erickson of Anthropology and the University Museum: CIS106/ANTH258 Visualizing the Past; Peopling the Past. The research goals implicitly embedded in the pedagogy within this course are to understand, recreate, and reanimate the likely or typical (day-to- day) and extraordinary (festivals, religious celebration) events that a particular site supported.
Our current subject environment is a Pre-Columbian Baures village in the Bolivian Amazon. This and other potential sites will provide a foundation for anthropological hypotheses on cultural and daily activities. It will also provide a pedagogical experience for learning about the past through direct interaction with its artifacts and community of people. Some of the main technical and ethnological questions considered are:
· How does the physical environment of a particular archaeological site influence daily human activities (food production, animal husbandry, travel, raw materials, social and religious rites, etc.)?· How do we establish how such activities translate to animatable human behaviors for people inhabiting that site?· What are appropriate and effective user interfaces to explore environment-driven behaviors, population distributions and movements, and culture-specific characters?· How can Virtual Reality be used to provide an active observer with compelling visual and participatory experiences in such a site?· How should the active observer appear in the simulation (as observed by other active observers as well as the Non-Player Characters)?· What kinds of user interactivity produce pedagogical and academic engagement in such simulations?The project work will be done using Maya, UnReal Engine, UnReal's Blueprint programming environment, and other programming in C++ as needed.

I've been collecting summer projects from all the faculty and here's what I have so far:

===
Mayur Naik - mhnaik@seas.upenn.eduI am happy to supervise CIS undergrads who have taken some combination of CIS 120, 121, 160, 262 and done well. They must be good at programming and, as a bonus, in theory/algorithms. Here's more information about research projects in my group: http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/phd_visit_day_naik.pptx . Any of the below choices (pay, REU, etc.) is fine.

===Mark Liberman - markyliberman@gmail.com
(1) Transcription, annotation and analysis of ~10k hours of neuropsychological examinations, in collaboration with the Framingham Heart Study. The aims:
Aim 1: Generate ""gold standard"" transcripts of 8000+ existing voice recordings as well as those being acquired through on-going neuropsy. testing of all FHS cohorts. Aim 2: Analysis of the 8000+ existing voice recordings obtained between 2005-present using existing voice recognition and voice analysis software. Aim 3: Build additional software to analyze the digital voice signals and generate novel cognitive metrics from latency and other behavioral characteristics. Aim 4: For each neuropsychological tests as well as across tests, identify normative values for e-voice metrics stratified by age, education, sex, both individually and in combination (e.g., age x education; age x sex; age x education x sex) Aim 5: Conduct factor and cluster analysis of e-cognitive metrics across neuropsychological tests to identify domain specific measures. Aim 6: Determine e-voice metrics/profiles that differentiate between those with and without known AD risk factors, including but not limited to, ApoE, family history of dementia/AD, homocysteine, vascular risk factors (including metabolic), inflammatory markers. Aim 7: Determine whether neuroimaging biomarkers are related to e-voice metrics/profiles. Aim 8: Determine whether incident change in neuroimaging biomarkers and neuropsychological tests are related to e-cognitive profiles. Aim 9: Determine whether e-voice metrics/profiles can differentiate participants who are low to high risk for dementia/AD. Aim 10: Conduct data driven analyses to identify e-voice metrics/profiles predictive of AD endophenotypes and risk for dementia/AD, in isolation and in combination with other health, lifestyle, biomarkers and genetic risk factors.
Everyone will start out on segmentation and transcription of (a sample of) the recordings, using software and procedures that you'll be trained on. We'll then be developing ways to automate stages of the process via machine-learning procedures, compile relevant measurements, and to analyze the results. A team of researchers and student workers is already set up for this project, but we're interested in recruiting additional participants.
(2) Analysis of student writing, peer and instructor evaluations, and the evolution of drafts, in collaboration with Penn's Critical Writing program. One or two summer positions will be available.
Both projects pay $13/hour to start.

2018 Research Topics include:

Norman Badler
Repopulating and interactively experiencing prehistoric sites will be a significant focus of Badler's summer project. Over the past decade I have co-taught an undergraduate course with Dr. Clark Erickson of Anthropology and the University Museum: CIS106/ANTH258 Visualizing the Past; Peopling the Past. The research goals implicitly embedded in the pedagogy within this course are to understand, recreate, and reanimate the likely or typical (day-to- day) and extraordinary (festivals, religious celebration) events that a particular site supported.
Our current subject environment is a Pre-Columbian Baures village in the Bolivian Amazon. This and other potential sites will provide a foundation for anthropological hypotheses on cultural and daily activities. It will also provide a pedagogical experience for learning about the past through direct interaction with its artifacts and community of people. Some of the main technical and ethnological questions considered are:
· How does the physical environment of a particular archaeological site influence daily human activities (food production, animal husbandry, travel, raw materials, social and religious rites, etc.)?· How do we establish how such activities translate to animatable human behaviors for people inhabiting that site?· What are appropriate and effective user interfaces to explore environment-driven behaviors, population distributions and movements, and culture-specific characters?· How can Virtual Reality be used to provide an active observer with compelling visual and participatory experiences in such a site?· How should the active observer appear in the simulation (as observed by other active observers as well as the Non-Player Characters)?· What kinds of user interactivity produce pedagogical and academic engagement in such simulations?The project work will be done using Maya, UnReal Engine, UnReal's Blueprint programming environment, and other programming in C++ as needed.

Chenfanfu Jiang
""Multi-physics"" phenomena involves in the simulation of solids, fluids, through their different phases, scales and interactions. There is not a numerically perfect physics-based simulation scheme that is always suitable for all scenarios. We desire to hybrid strengths of different methods to enable animating complex material interactions. The summer projects will target at several aspects for multi-physics simulation, with a focus on the Material Point Method and Finite Element Method:
(1) High performance GPU optimization of existing schemes;(2) Novel numerical interrogators for efficient numerical simulation of hard, constrained cases;(3) Coupled, spatial and temporal adaptive hybrid simulation of various schemes;(4) The look into frictional contact, and resolving algorithm-inherent, geometry-related problems.The student works with state-of-the-art solid/fluid C++ solvers and develops new features and experiments with research ideas. The student will also work with 3D software such as Houdini for modeling and rendering simulation geometry. C++ background and experience with some physics-based simulation is required.

<p>Problem:</p>
<p></p>
<p>A seller will run a second-price, sealed-bid auction for an object. There are two bidders, a and b, who have independent, private values vi which are either 0 or 1. For both bidders the probabilities of vi = 0 and vi = 1 are each 1/2. Both bidders understand the auction, but bidder b sometimes makes a mistake about his value for the object.

Let’s suppose that when b’s value is 0 he acts as if it is 1 with probability 1/2 and as if it is 0 with probability 1/2 . So in effect bidder b sees value 0 with probability 1/4 and value 1 with probability 3/4 . Bidder a never makes mistakes about his value for the object, but he is aware of the mistakes that bidder b makes. Both bidders bid optimally given their perceptions of the value of the object.
