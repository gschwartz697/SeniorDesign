"Does this mean at most one pair at all times, or can a candy be in one pair at one time and another pair at another time? For example, let's say we have:

a, b, c, d, e, f

we compare messages of a and b and they have the same message, so then we eat a and keep b and then compare b to c. Is this ok?","Kind of unspecific title, but here's what I mean:

If we have n elements, and in SOME cases we do a fraction of n operations, but in doing a fraction of n operations means that we skipped doing operations for that same fraction of n, can we consider that O(n) or is it O(n squared)?

What I mean:

Say we have these elements:
A B C D E F G H I J
Let's say that E and J both do about 5 operations, so n/2. But if we can prove that in such cases, approximately n/2 other elements do LESS operations than usually, could we ""average"" the operations over all elements and say that it is still O(n) and not O(n^2)?","Hello, on the hw solutions for q3, the description of the algorithm says to choose the s'th smallest element in Diff, then outputs all costumes corresponding to those numbers in C that are less than t. Isn't that mixing up a difference with an actual price?

Also, in the next step, it says to add s-x costumes corresponding to the sth smallest element in x. Can someone explain this as well?

Thanks.","Hello, on the hw solutions for q3, the description of the algorithm says to choose the s'th smallest element in Diff, then outputs all costumes corresponding to those numbers in C that are less than t. Isn't that mixing up a difference with an actual price?

"In general, when proving divide/conquer algorithms, does it work better to:

1) Use strong induction, assuming the algorithm works for a certain sized input and showing how a bigger input scales down, or

2) Assume for the sake of contradiction that a case fails, and that the case is the smallest case that fails. Show that this case failing means a smaller one must have failed, which is a contradiction

Or, is there another procedure that works better?","Are there any examples of a valid proof of correctness for a recursive/divide-and-conquer algorithm?

Do we have to prove that dividing a binary number by two decreases the # of bits by 1?

Basically, my algorithm is as such:
1)find the median
2) create new array with differences between median and original array
3) Find sth smallest element of new array. This is the cutoff, and everything equal to it or smaller than it should be included
4) iterate through new array and return indices of every element smaller than the cutoff until I get s elements
However, a case arises with repeats that is very unique and I am not sure if I am meant to know how to handle it. Should I account for this case:
s=3, array ={1,1,2,2,4}, median = 2
The three closest elements to the median should be one of the ones and both of the twos. However, the difference array becomes {1,1,0,0,2} and the 3rd smallest element becomes 1, which becomes the cutoff. If I iterate through this array from front to end in the 4th step, I will pickup both of ones, where I only want one. Should I figure out a way to beat this case or is this a case you guys have not considered?
