Hello! I am getting an error accessing the specific columns of the table using get- I am using JSoup. I was wondering if anyone knows why that might be.

"I've been attempting HW4 by adding several of an author's books to the corpus, then comparing each of the documents together. However, the calculated cosine similarities are VERY low (&lt;0.05), which I thought didn't make any sense. I then realized that, if there are a lot of words that appear in ALL the documents, each of them will be represented by a ""0"" in the Weight vector of each document (since the IDF of that term will be 0). How do we account for this in determining how similar documents actually are?","Do we need to normalize our tf values? (i.e. instead of just using the frequency of the term in for a specific document, using the frequency of the term divided by the total number of words in the document). I did not normalize and the IR book (https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/06vect.pdf) doesn't, but I just wanted to check that this was okay.",,,

"Let's say we have a document that only contains one phrase.

When comparing that document to other documents that also contain that phrase, won't cosine similarity favor the documents that have the phrase only once (as opposed to a document that may have the phrase several times).

Or am I not doing my calculation correctly?","My impression is that cos similarity is supposed to be higher when 2 documents are similar.

For HW5, my group is analyzing Amazon data (~500,000 products). I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the average shortest path length between all pairs of products. I was going to compare that value with the average shortest path length between all products and the product with the best sales rank. However, my runtime is horrible and I can't figure out how to improve it. I've tested the code on small inputs (~30 products) and it works, but it's been running for 12.5hrs and it's only calculated ~5,000 shortest paths. Do you have any advice? I've attached my code for Dijkstra's, in case that helps. My underlying graph is a HashMap, so lookup is constant, and my Item objects store neighbors in HashMaps as well. I'm using Iterators to get the objects for calculating the paths. 

Thanks
