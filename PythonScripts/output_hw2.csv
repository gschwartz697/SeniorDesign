"Two questions:

1). I wanted to run an experiment that needs to consider an increasing number of populations (ranging from 3-5 populations instead of 2 like the examples you gave in the file), but it doesn't open the visualizer or finish any of the tests. I saw @110, but do you have any suggestions for this in particular that might help some more? 

2). Could you explain what the seed number does and how a lower/higher number might change my tests?","I wanted to know if this counted as something to experiment--I wanted to test a different definition of happiness (to include people a distance of 2 or 4 away instead of just 1 away) with different minNeighbor thresholds. This doesn't really require me to change much code (only the isHappy() function), but does this count as a valid experiment?","I'm confused about what we are being asked to do. Are we just adjusting parameters when making a new Schelling object to test out a certain segmentation?

For example, if I wanted to see how people in different economical classes segment, would I just be changing the class size? Or would I have to make more adjustments to the program?

"The book only defines a violation of the triadic closure principle. If a node does not have two strong edges coming out of it, and therefore cannot violate the principle, does it then fulfill the principle by default? ","If there is no direct edge from node A to node B, but there is an intermediary node C that has edges to A and to B, does that count as an edge between A and B (in terms of strong triadic closure)?"
"For part 1, question 1 what is meant by ""the start time of B must be less than or equal to the finish time of A"". What is the start time? Like is it when DFS reaches node B? Is the finish time the time when A is taken off the recursive stack (if DFS is recursively implemented)? I am just confused by the wording of this question.","The question says that when we have a choice, we should go for the node that appears earlier in the alphabet. Is this talking about when we are implementing DFS? Or how the final outcome should look like?

For example, should we start our DFS with $$m$$ because it goes earlier in the alphabet? Or start our DFS with $$z$$ so that the final outcome puts $$z$$ towards the end, like in the alphabet?"
"Do the Schelling programs count 8 neighbors as the max, or are they only counting the adjacent ones (so maximum of 4 like neighbors?)","In CIS 121, we learned that the topological sort algorithm is
1) Run DFS
2) Return the nodes in reverse postorder (reverse order of the DFS finish times)

Should we use this or the method from class which was
1) Remove the nodes and all their edges in order of increasing in-degree (ex. start with those with 0 incoming edges, etc.)
?

I know both are conceptually the same, but since we are choosing nodes alphabetically, the result changes.
For example, does that mean choose the nodes alphabetically while doing DFS? Or does it mean choose alphabetically when choosing which remaining node of minimum in-degree?"

"Hi, I'm not really sure what to do for the coding portion of the homework. When it wants us to test a sociological question and expand parameters, does it mean that we should modify one of the parameters passed into the SchellingSimulator object or should we create a new parameter and modify all of the methods to take into account the effect of the new parameter? If it is the latter, I'm not really sure how I should modify the other methods. ","For part 2 I think I misinterpreted the question. I thought we were supposed to modify the actual model instead of just expanding the set of parameters. I modified the program to see if segregation still occurs as much if instead of considering the nodes that are directly up, down, left, right, and diagonal to be a neighbor, we just considered diagonal nodes as neighbors. Is what I did wrong and should I redo this part of the assignment?","If we change the numClasses parameter in SchellingSimulator to a different number (say 5), would we have to change anything else to make the code work?  I've been trying to change the number of classes to 5 but am not sure what else I would have to modify besides the numClasses parameter."

","Can someone explain the following syntax to me?

private void simulateUntilHappy() {  while (!movementRound())    ;}

I understand that putting movementRound() while condition will run the method, and then check to see the value it returns. Why is there a sole ';' inside the brackets, however?"
"When I try to run this program with the following arguments, the program stops running before it does all 100 trials and the visual representation doesn't show up. Any idea why? I increased the number of classes argument by 1 and kept the other arguments the same.
simulator = new SchellingSimulator(1, 3, (int) (50 * 50 * 0.92), 4, 50, 50);","For some cases, I get NAN as output

Should we write a topo sort algo and apply it to the graph or can we do it by hand?,"If we don't use Schelling Visualizer in our experimentation, is it ok to only submit our write up and the Schelling Simulator code?"
"So I was messing around with the simulator for part 2, and changing the number of groups. I realized that when I increased the number of groups, the simulator wouldn't get through all 100 trials and would get stuck in an infinite loop within the simulate function. However, what I really thought was interesting is that it seems to get stuck on the same trial number each time I run the program. But if it's actually randomly populating the grid each time simulate runs, shouldn't it also randomly get stuck on a certain trial?","I'm working on the Schelling Model for HW 2 am confused about what the question is asking. It asks to model some sociological question with the simulator, which I understand. However, after doing this and making comparisons, do I need to compare the results of the simulation to what actually ended up happening in real life? Or should I just analyze the results of the model and explain why they are what they are?"

The movie appears in wikipedia as Divorce Italian Style. Is this a typo in the instructions?","Can we assume that we're only looking for awards that are titled exactly as the user inputs it as?
