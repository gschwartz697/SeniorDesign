I'm a bit confused as to how you can compare an element to a qnode? I just compared element to qnode.v without using ==. That would check if the value is in the queue at all. Also, more generally, can a queue have the same values? ie 2-3-2-4-5? since the first 2 points to 3 and the second 2 points to 4 they are different qnodes.

Hello! I wrote a bit of code and it passes the tests. However, I just wanted to be sure that I understood what was going on. Would it be appropriate to understand the references as sort of a mutable local variable in Java? Essentially, whenever I make a value controller and update it by changing it or adding listeners, will the value controller continue to have the value reference and the listeners reference to store the data? And would I just be mutating the references to store different information? I was a bit unsure as I am making the value and listeners as sort of ""local"" but I think it would make more sense to make the part of the record to be ""inherent"" to the controller. ","let make_control (v: 'a) : 'a value_controller =let l = { contents = []} in    let x = { contents = v }  in     {   add_change_listener = fun y:(a' -&gt; unit) -&gt; l::y;   get_value = fun -&gt; x.contents;   change_value = fun y:('a) -&gt; x.contents &lt;- 'a; List.iter l    }

"Hi!

I'm working on task 6, trying to do the color sliders. My first instinct to accomplish this task was to have the sliders affect the color (i.e paint.color.r &lt;- __), however I would have to make the type mutable in gctx, which wouldn't work b/c the gctx is supposed to be immutable.

My next idea is to make the widget have a value controller that holds a number from 0-255 depending on the location of the mouse. Then I would create a mutable type in paint.ml that was of the same form as the type of color and could update. Then, ideally, I could apply that mutable color type to paint.color and all would be well and good. However, I have a few concerns I would like to run past someone before I change a bunch of my code:

1- Am I right in assuming I can't make the color type mutable? When I tried to change it it said that it was incompatible with the cmi but I don't know what that is.

2- Will it be an issue if I use a record within paint.ml and try to apply to to paint.color? I'm not sure it will work, since one is mutable and the other is not and because the type is only defined within Gctx so I don't think it will even be applicable. 

3- Is it necessary to create an entirely new mutable state in paint that co-exists with color? It does not seem efficient, but I am not sure where else to look for color mutability.

Basically all I've played around with so far has lead to errors but I can't make office hours. I think my main confusion rests in what is allowed to be mutable. I want to make sure that I am understanding this conceptually before I change a bunch of code.

Hello! I've been struggling with the checkbox and had some questions. I chose the method of making a separate widget for the box and adding a notifier to the hpaired box + label so that wherever you click within the widget, it registers the event and changes the value in the boolean controller. I chose to implement the actual crossing by adding a change_listener to the boolean controller. 

The feedback I got from a TA was, however, that ""You may also want to consider the differences between change_listeners and event_listeners.  Neither is better or worse, but it may simplify your code to choose one approach to registering events."" I do see a way I can just use event_listeners, but I don't see how I can approach the entire problem using just change_listeners as I don't see a way to register a click for the entire widget other than event_listeners. Could I get some help with that?

Hello!

I implemented my checkbox, and it passed all the tests/lightbulb so now I'm on the part of making it toggle. My first question is: I noticed that for buttons, lables, notifiers, etc. we don't actually pass in a g value both in paint and widget. In what part of the program do we pass in the g and actually draw the thing? I was confused because for instance, when we do hpair, how does it know the initial graphics context to be in?

And my second question is: would there be a more efficient way to do the toggle? Or in fact, I don't even think what I am doing now is correct as I don't think I am constantly checking the value of the boolean controller. Or am I because the event loop is running?

Then, we need to create a palette of pixels that have the highest color frequency. Say 20 is the max, then my palette would be those 20 pixels that have color r=10, g=10, b=10.

I don't really understand what ""Then change each pixel in the picture to one with the closest matching color from your palette"" means.","Hey y'all

So I'm still kind of confused. How does the equation for contrast actually work?

Let's say our photo consists of 3 pixels: A (100, 150, 200), B (50, 100, 150) and C (0, 50, 100). When we sum all the values of all the color components in all of the pixels and divide it by three, do we create a new pixel ""p"" within the for loop that would produce a new pixel A of (150, 150, 150) and B of (100, 100, 100) and C of (50, 50, 50) [since the average of all three numbers in A, B, and C are 150, 100 and 50 respectively]. Or... do we add all the R components (100, 50, 0) and label the average color intensity of R as 50 (and G as 100, and B as 150)?

When we subtract the average color intensity from each color component of each pixel, for pixel A.getRed ( ) would that produce 100 - 50 [the average color intensity of R] or would that produce 100 - 150 [the average color intensity of pixel A]? Then, we multiply final result by multiplier, right?

Sorry for the long question, I've been a little bit confused by this problem in particular.

And then for the reduceColorPalette, I just wanted to know if we were supposed to use ColorMap to create our color palette.

To fill my colorMap, I first start with two outer loops to traverse the width and height of the picture (w and h). Then, I use pixel p[w][h] and compare ""p"" with every previous pixel q (up until the point I reached p) in a nested pair of two inner loops. 

This probably creates a lot of lag.

"While implementing blur, I initially did it using the method defined in the docs, where a neighborhood around a single pixel is considered. However, I ran into a couple inconsistencies and wanted to know if an alternate implementation was OK.

1. If the initial neighborhood centers around (0, 0), the top and left edges have half-sized (or smaller) neighborhoods. I know this can't really be avoided, but is it ok to start with squares whose top left corners were within the bounds of the picture? I think it looks better if the bottom/right edges are the ones with smaller neighborhoods.

2. If the neighborhoods are defined by their center, there is a noticeable gap on the right/bottom edges at larger radii. The center is off the edge, but if the radius is 10 there could be 5 pixels on the edge where no blur is applied. Since the maximum radius is 19, the effect is noticeable.

My alternative solution was to define the neighborhoods by the top left corner, which makes it look less visually bizarre (point 1) and also fix the strip of unblurred pixels (point 2) since r+1 pixels are not needed to make a neighborhood. Is this ok?","My current implementation just uses boatloads of if statements to check if a pixel is one that I care about. But then I realized I end up skipping some pixels.

For instance in the following picture my function will take pixels marked with O but skip those with X. Center pixel to average around is C. And so on for each ""concentric"" box in the radius.

"I'm a little confused about organizing data in the ServerModel class.

My biggest concern with both of these way is that data can go out of sync. If a user disconnects, I will have to check to every single channel and ensure the user is removed from all of them. Doing this if every channel exists as a collection within ServerModel would be a bother, so this leads me to believe that I should create a channel class. Once all the channels are stored in a collection within ServerModel I can run a for-each loop and remove the disconnected user from every channel.So, I am not sure if I'm on the right track or not.

Another idea I have is to disregard everything above, and simply add a linked list field to my User class which currently stores the id and nickname. I can simply add channels to linked list of a user when the user joins a channel. When the user is deregistered, the user's channel bindings are deleted along with the user. This way all the data is stored in the main collection of users inside ServerModel. The potential issue I can see with this is when I have to send a message to all users of a particular channel, I will have to go through every single user in the main registeredUsers collections, find who all is a part of the selected channel and send a message to them.

I'm really confused though because I've specifically accounted for this in my code. Before calling broadcast.okay, I call a removeUserFromChannel method on the current model instance. This method, before removing a user from a specific channel through updates to the model state, sets a static field in the ServerModel class to be equal to the collection of users in that specified channel.

I start off by making a Map for Channels in ServerModel.java:
 private Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; registeredUsers;
 private Map&lt;String, Channel&gt; channelList;

 public ServerModel() {
  registeredUsers = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;(); //Initializing our map of registered users
  channelList = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;();
 }
 

And then, I create a Channel:
    public void createChannel(String channelName, String owner)
    {
     Channel c = new Channel (owner);
     channelList.put(channelName, c);
     c.addUserChannel(owner);
    }

Moving on to the Channel class itself, here's what I have for the file:
import java.util.*;

public final class Channel {
 private Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; usersList;
 private Set&lt;String&gt; usersInChannelList;
 private String owner;

 public Channel(String owner) {
  usersList = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;(); //Initializing our map of users in a specific channel
  this.owner = owner;
 }

 public String getOwner()
 {
  return this.owner;
 }


 public void addUserChannel(String nickname)
 {
  usersInChannelList.add(nickname);
 }


 public void removeUserChannel(String nickname)
 {  
  usersInChannelList.remove(nickname);
 }

 public Set&lt;String&gt; getUsersInChannel()
 {
  return usersInChannelList;
 }

}



And my CreateChannel command in Command.java:
/**
 * Represents a {@link Command} issued by a client to create a new channel.
 */
class CreateCommand extends Command {
    private String channel;
    private boolean inviteOnly;

    public CreateCommand(int senderId, String sender, String channel, boolean inviteOnly) {
        super(senderId, sender);
        this.channel = channel;
        this.inviteOnly = inviteOnly;
    }

    @Override
    public Broadcast updateServerModel(ServerModel model) {
        String sender = getSender();
     Collection &lt;String&gt; newCol = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
     newCol.add(sender);
      if (ServerModel.isValidName(channel))
         {
          model.createChannel(channel, getSender());
          return Broadcast.okay(this, newCol);
         }
      
     if (model.getChannels().contains(channel))
        {
         return Broadcast.error(this, ServerError.NAME_ALREADY_IN_USE);
        }
       
        return Broadcast.error(this, ServerError.INVALID_NAME);
    }

    public String getChannel() {
        return channel;
    }

    public boolean isInviteOnly() {
        return inviteOnly;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        int flag = inviteOnly ? 1 : 0;
        return String.format("":%s CREATE %s %d"", getSender(), channel, flag);
    }
}



Every time I run the program, it fails on a Null Pointer exception in my Channel.java class at this line: 
public void addUserChannel(String nickname)
 {
  usersInChannelList.add(nickname);
 }
 which I don't quite understand why it is throwing such an exception.

A null pointer exception is also found at my createChannel method in: 
c.addUserChannel(owner);

As well as in UpdateServerModel in: 
model.createChannel(channel, getSender());

And finally in the test itself, testCreateNewChannel, at 
assertEquals(""broadcast"", expected, create.updateServerModel(model));


I have been over and over my code and can't seem to find anything incorrect, although there clearly is something afoot as a null pointer exception has been found four times. I would really appreciate just even a hint as to which part to look at and try to edit. Thank you so much!",,,,,,,,
"I failed the 
testNickCollision, testNickNotInChannels, testNickCollisionOnConnect

This is one of the test previously provided. I don't understand why the recipients actually include the new nickname. My understanding is that since this user is not in any channel, so no body should be sent the broadcast?

 public Collection&lt;String&gt; changeNickname(int userId, String newNickname) {    	String nickname = getNickname(userId);    	allUsers.replace(userId, newNickname);    	Collection&lt;String&gt; recipients = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();    	Iterator&lt;Channel&gt; iterator = allChannels.iterator();        while(iterator.hasNext()) {            Channel c = iterator.next();            if (c.getUserNames().contains(nickname)) {    			recipients.addAll(c.getUserNames());    			recipients.remove(nickname);    			c.changeNicknameInChannel(userId,newNickname);    			if (c.getOwnerName().equals(nickname)) {    				c.setOwner(newNickname);    			}    		}        } 	   	    	    	return recipients;}

This isn't working for me though, any suggestions?","My first failure when I submitted the homework was: ""deregister sends disconnected appropriately to multiple channels.""

I am a bit confused on what this means. My code adds all users who were in a channel with the disconnected user to a set of users to be notified. I am not necessarily supposed to send this to ""multiple channels,"" just users from any channel that the original user was in, right?

Here is my code for this method:
public Broadcast deregisterUser(int userId) {

    	// delete user from the channels they are in
    	Set&lt;String&gt; usersNotify = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();

""file"" is a TreeMap &lt;String, TreeSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;( );
String is the misspelled word
TreeSet&lt;String&gt; is a set of correct words that can ""replace"" the misspelled word.

Question:
1. Currently, I don't think the statement condition (b.read( ) != -1) in my while statement is good enough. Is there anything that I could improve on/consider in this conditional?
2. When I read in the line using a buffered reader ""b,"" I take in the whole line, take in the index and substring the line according to what comes before the comma and what comes after the comma. Is this good enough, or are there other things I should consider?
3. I'm worried my choice in data structure is too complicated... should I be looking to implement something simpler? I'm scared of moving forward in the homework b/c in HW07 I did really badly because I pushed forward with a double TreeMap and it was super hard :-(
4. When I try to ""put"" the correct word into the TreeSet as the ""value"" of the &lt;k, v&gt; TreeMap ""file,"" should I make the TreeSet into a private field at the top of my code, or should I instantiate the TreeSet in my while loop? This is already feeling too complicated... :'(
5. ""words.add"" returns a boolean but I need it to return a TreeSet... I am also stuck on this as well.

Do I need to account for any possible IOExceptions in next() in TokenScanner or can I assume these will only happen in the constructor?,"If we have an auto-generated catch block that catches IOException e and the only thing it does is e.printStackTrace(), can we leave it as it is or do we have to handle exceptions another way?",,,,,,,,

Basically I just want to test if it returns a space.

But what actually happens is my next method gets caught in a while loop reading a question mark ""?"".
However, within my while loop if I put a break statement to prevent the loop, it correctly returns the space character. What might be causing this? The relevant portion of my next method is below.

//return non word characters

"When my TokenScanner is a string of ""Aren't you /ntired"", my function is recognizing ""Aren't"" as the first word token and returning it in the first call to d.next(). However, because I'm calling rd.read() in my while-loop and again at the beginning of my try-block, I think it's skipping over the whitespace after the ""Aren't"". What should be happening is that when it hits the whitespace, it registers it as a non-word character and funnels through to the else block of this function. 

However, I need to first set a to rd.read() in order to let my function recognize the input. Here, when I call it for the first time, I set ""a"" to ""A"" (for ""Aren't) and that's what gets my function off the ground.

"Hello y'all,

Quick 3-question:
1. how are we supposed to pass in the string with which we want to check against the dictionary.isWord( )?
2. do we create a private field string outside of the constructor? 
3. will we need to map incorrect words to a set of correct words, or just store possible correct words from the dictionary into a set that we end up returning in getCorrections( )?

private TreeSet&lt;String&gt; store = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;(); // the set of corrections
 private String word; // the word we are producing a set of corrections for

    public SwapCorrector(Dictionary dict) {
     this.word = word;","For checkDocument I've seen other posts saying that the Scanner class should be used to get the user input.

1) How do we use the Scanner class to do that? Do we do sc.next()? Should this be returning an int?

2) Once we've used our Corrector to output a set of corrections for the wrong word, how do we present those words (alphabetically) to the user? There are literally no instructions for how to do this.

I assume that once we present the correction to the user we just use the user input to determine which of those corrections to write out. But if the user chooses the ""different"" option and inputs their own word, do we have to handle that ourselves as well?",,,,,,,,
