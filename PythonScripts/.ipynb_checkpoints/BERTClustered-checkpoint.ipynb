If the initial neighborhood centers around (0, 0), the top and left edges have half-sized (or smaller) neighborhoods. I know this can't really be avoided, but is it ok to start with squares whose top left corners were within the bounds of the picture? I think it looks better if the bottom/right edges are the ones with smaller neighborhoods.\\n\\n2. If the neighborhoods are defined by their center, there is a noticeable gap on the right/bottom edges at larger radii. The center is off the edge, but if the radius is 10 there could be 5 pixels on the edge where no blur is applied. Since the maximum radius is 19, the effect is noticeable.\\n\\nMy alternative solution was to define the neighborhoods by the top left corner, which makes it look less visually bizarre (point 1) and also fix the strip of unblurred pixels (point 2) since r+1 pixels are not needed to make a neighborhood.
