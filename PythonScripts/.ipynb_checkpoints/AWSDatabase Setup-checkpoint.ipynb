OCaml has two characteristics that answer your last question: it is strongly statically typed (this means that everything has to have one type, and the types are set/determined at compile time, as opposed to runtime) and it uses type inferencing (it tries to guess what type something will be based on context clues). In this case, OCaml won\\'t know which branch of the if/then/else the code will enter until runtime, but it still has to determine the type at compile time.\\xa0Furthermore, we already recognized that the entire expression must simplify to a single type (the \"return\" type of the function). Combining these two facts, then each branch of the if/then/else must evaluate to the same type, so that it won\\'t matter which branch gets used at runtime, the types will still check out.\\xa0If all the branches are of type int, the final \"else\" must also provide some value of type int.

My Parent-Hamming scored very low. I want to change it but intuitively it makes sense to me and I\\'m not sure whats wrong. When I remove some of the recursive Parent_Hamming calls on the 2nd Pattern Match I get something that closely resembles the tree we are looking for (not exact). However, I don\\'t understand how I can remove those Parent_Hamming calls and ignore the other half of the tree. Here is my code.\\xa0\\n\\nlet rec parent_child_hamming (t: labeled_tree) : int =\\n  begin match t with\\n  | LLeaf (_) -&gt; 0\\n  | LNode (lt, parent, rt) -&gt; \\n    begin match (lt, rt) with \\n    | LLeaf x, LLeaf y -&gt; hamming_distance x parent + hamming_distance y parent\\n    | LLeaf x, y -&gt; hamming_distance x parent + parent_child_hamming y\\n    | x, LLeaf y -&gt; hamming_distance y parent + parent_child_hamming x\\n    | x, y -&gt; parent_child_hamming x + parent_child_hamming y\\n    end\\n  end\\n\\nThanks for any help.\\xa0\\n(P.S.)

It's just an example to underline the question.\\nP(n): sum from i=0 to n of i = n(n+1)/2\\n\\nLet us now take an arbitrary k. Assume that sum from i=0 to k of i = k(k+1)/2.\\nTo prove P(n), we need to show that P(k+1) is true as well. So I need to be able to show that sum from i=0 to k+1 of i = (k+1)(k+2)/2\\n\\nSo here's how I'd do it:\\nI have the equation where LHS: sum from i=0 to k of i, and RHS: k(k+1)/2\\nI now add k+1 to both sides of the equation, which is a perfectly valid operation.\\nI now have: k+1 + the previous sum = k(k+1)/2 + k + 1\\nThe LHS simplifies to the LHS I want to obtain.\\nBy doing algebra, I can say that RHS = k(k+1)/2 + 2(k+1)/2 = (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is what I want to prove\\nTherefore, I used induction to prove my claim.\\n\\nSo here's my question: The way I just used induction (Or the way that I understood it), is that I took the equality I assumed to hold true, and modified it algebraically to obtain what I want to show.\\nHowever! in the lecture notes, it looks to me as if you are taking the equality that you want to prove, and modifying it algebraically to obtain what you assumed to be true. (Not exactly, but more like that you are taking the LHS of what you want to prove, and then modifying the RHS by substituting something from what you assumed into it...)\\nThe question I have is simply: Is the way I used induction above WRONG or NOT, and if yes, why? I used it for both of the homework questions, so I don't really want to submit before I don't know whether I did something horribly wrong or not.\\n\\nThanks a lot!\\xa0\", \"\\nThe way you did the induction is not incorrect in this case, but is wrong in general.\\n\\nWhen we do induction, we want to prove that our claim holds for n = k + 1. However, this means that we should start with our k + 1 case, and modify that algebraically to achieve an equality. For example, rather than starting with $$\\\\sum_{i = 0}^{k} i = \\\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$, we want to start with $$\\\\sum_{i = 0}^{k + 1} i$$, and algebraically modify that to show that $$\\\\sum_{i = 0}^{k + 1} i = \\\\frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}$$ using the Induction Hypothesis.\\n\\nIn this case, you may think that there's no difference between what we just did here versus what you did--and you'd be correct. However, it only works because our claim is something purely algebraic. Consider a problem involving k intersecting lines, and a claim about how many times those lines intersect. To prove the claim for n = k + 1, we would have to start with our k + 1 lines. If we tried to just start with k lines (similar to you starting with $$\\\\sum_{i = 0}^{k} i$$) and\\xa0construct our k + 1 lines, we would have to prove that our construction covers every possible case of how the k + 1 lines could intersect, which is not feasible. Therefore, you should always start with your n = k + 1 case, find a way to split it into an n = k case and something else, and use the Induction Hypothesis on the n = k case to prove the claim.
