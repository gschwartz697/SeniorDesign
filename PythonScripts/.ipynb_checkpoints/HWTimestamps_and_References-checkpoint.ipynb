I dropped my old recitation and when I tried to add a new one the, the system wouldn't let me. I would like to switch into 214, 216, 217, all of which Penn in Touch says are open. I would, at this point, also be happy to take my old spot back, which was in 211, which I believe is now closed. I am very concerned that without the recitation slot, Penn in Touch will soon delete my lecture spot, as well. Could someone please help me re-register for recitation? \n",

Similarly line 352 is giving me a,  syntax error, expecting \"in\". Can someone help me make sense of why I'm getting these errors? Also the bottom got cut off. I'm returning the string \"direction\"\n",

Thus, the type of your function is int -&gt; (int * string) list -&gt; string, when it is supposed to be generic (and the interface expects generic arguments). \n",

      "I'm a little confused by the invariance on sets. In problem 6 it states: \" NOTE: We are going to maintain the additional invariants that this list is sorted in ascending order, and contains no duplicates.\" Is this referring to the \"output\" of our functions or the sets themselves?\n",

      "Thanks! \n",
      " Shortened Question:  \n",
      " Answer: A Set (in general) has no duplicate elements and is unordered. What this means is that if I construct a set by adding 1, then 2, then 2, and then 1, I get an equivalent set to adding 2 and then 1 (to the empty set in both cases). However, when we are actually implementing a set, we can represent them in a number of different ways. One way would be to simply use a list and remove duplicates. This would make certain operations easier, like add (just look through the list and see if the element is there, and if not, add it), but it would make other operations hard to implement, like equals. In this HW, we are representing sets as sorted lists, which helps us implement certain functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, inside the module where you are implementing OLSet, a set is an ordered list, and this helps with implementing some functions. Outside the module, you don't know how the set is implemented, so all you know are the properties of the Set interface and the invariant that sets are unordered and have no duplicates. \n",

      " Shortened Question:  \n",
      " Answer: Failures have to do with tests, errors have to do with exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A failure means that one of your tests did not return the expected value. For example, you have the test:\n",
      "  let test () : bool =\n",

      "\n",
      "Errors means that your code or one of the frameworks it depends on raised an exception.  So, somewhere along the line, a function received some input that the code author figured it would be logically best to raise an exception rather than continue letting the code execute. The reason you're probably a little tripped up is because OCaml uses the `failwith` keyword to raise an exception. So, even though it contains the word \"fail\", `failwith` has to do with exceptions, not test failures.\n",

      "To clarify the mechanics though, look at slides 54 and 55 in lecture 13. When we said p2 = p1, the ASM went ahead and found the value of p1 and then set p2 to point to the same value. It's the same idea here. You can think of variables on the stack as key-value pairs, where the var name is the key and the value is either the primitive data type stored there (e.g. an integer), or the pointer to the heap (which you can visualize as the arrow itself). Any time you use the key (i.e. z) in the workspace, the ASM will substitute it with its corresponding value (i.e. a pointer to the second structure on the heap here). \n",

Remember that the Some bubble is actually shorthand for the Some \"box\" that goes on the heap that in turn has a reference to the value inside the Some. If you have two items that are pointing to different Some boxes, they are DEFINITELY NOT referentially equal. Items that are structurally equal are \"automatically\" referentially equal, but it does not necessarily go the other way.

Add inputs 'a and 'a bag. add (add 1 empty) empty would first give us [1], but we can't add [1] to an empty bag because you cannot cons a list to another list (empty). For cons, I know that the left-hand side of the cons operator should be smaller than the right-hand side, so why does this not produce an ill-typed answer?\n",

      " Answer: Generally, fold has three components:  the current element being handled, the result of every future element being handled (the accumulator), and how to handle the \"last\" element (the base case).  If you can express a solution in these terms through a recursive pattern match function, you can likely express it using fold.\n",

Therefore, we only use constant stack space.\n",

      " Answer: Your reasoning is solid up until you write \"we know x is a 'a\".  Recall that x is only taking in 42 (an int) as an argument.  We don't know what x outputs, so the output of x is 'a.  Therefore x itself is (int -&gt; 'a).\n",

These constraints are designed to allow you to avoid logical errors and exceptions. OCaml's type system provides strong constraints on what code can compile, and due to this system the compiler can infer the type of any expression that compiles. For example, in some languages you can concatenate strings and lists using a + operator; this leaves the type of + ambiguous. In OCaml, the + operator applies specifically to adding integers (and in fact has type int -&gt; int -&gt; int). \n",

Even though I didn't write anything in the function body, since I specified the types in the anonymous function declaration, we know it will type check. The moral here is that it doesn't matter if the function is anonymous, what matters is that it's the right type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, sometimes we don't explicitly specify the types when we define anonymous functions, e.g. fold (fun x acc -&gt; ...) ... That's valid code, but I didn't say what x and acc have to be. So, now this becomes a problem of type inference. I.e. can we figure out the type of x and acc by looking at (in this case) 1) the definition of fold 2) the other inputs we pass fold and 3) the body of the anonymous function? Here's some examples to show how we do that:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) If I pass to fold a list of ints, then x must be an int. I know because in fold's def, the list input is a 'a list, and combine is 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b. So, an int list means all 'a values are ints.\n",
      "(2) With a function fun x -&gt; x + 1. That's valid OCaml, and x must be type int for the expression to type check because + requires to ints\n",
      "(3) If I pass fold fun x acc -&gt; x + acc again due to the definition of +, I know that x and acc both must be ints for it to type check. Now, that gives me a lot of info since combine is 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b (i.e. I could've written fun (x: 'a) (acc: 'b) : 'b = x + acc but we don't need to) and we know x is an int and acc is an int, so we know all throughout a call to fold involving this function, 'a and 'b are both int. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on, f x on the other hand would not type check because f expects as its first argument a 'a -&gt; 'a value, not a 'a value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's say we have let j (a: 'a) (b: 'a) : 'a = ... Now, j x is a valid partial application because j's type is 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a. And, j x has the type 'a -&gt; 'a.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the key with understanding function types is that every function can essentially be viewed as T1 -&gt; T2 where it takes T1 as an arg and returns T2. For f, T1 is 'a -&gt; 'a and T2 is 'a -&gt; unit. For h, T1 is 'a and T2 is 'a. For j, T1 is 'a and T2 is 'a -&gt; 'a. If you get that, you're in great shape. From that, you can also see that every function application where you pass it multiple arguments as once, e.g. add 1 2 is executed as a series of partial function applications where OCaml does add 1 2 ==&gt; aFuncThatAdds1ToItsArg 2 ==&gt; 3\n",

      " Answer: For these questions it is always good to break it up into parts. Starting with the inner-most expression, add 3 to empty creates an int set. Now moving outwards, remember add takes in two arguments, one is the element to be added, and one with the set of elements that the element should be added to, and returns the new set with the element. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, since we are partially applying add with the first argument as an int set, the compiler will assume that the next argument will be a set containing elements of the type of the first argument, i.e. an int set set. Since the add function would then return an int set set, we have that the type would be int set set -&gt; int set set.  \n",

      "Why is the type here int list list -&gt; (int -&gt; int) list list?  \n",
      " Shortened Question:  \n",
      " Answer: It is useful to proceed in a very careful manner with these questions. Here is the information we have so far: sum is a function that takes in 2 int arguments and transform is a function that takes in 2 arguments, one is a function and the other is a list. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now lets move from inwards out. We see that the function transform is taking in is transform sum. Note that here both transform and sum are partially applied. Consider only the inner transform for now. The function passed in is sum. Since sum takes in 2 arguments, applying sum to one integer argument would be partial application, and it would result in an int -&gt; int function. \n",
      "\n",
      "We know that the second argument to the inner transform has to be a list, and since sum is applied on it, it has to be an int list. Therefore, if transform sum is being called on an int list, and the int list is one element of the actual list, we have that the type of the actual list is int list list. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we know that transform sum transforms a list from an int list to an (int -&gt; int) list. Therefore, we know that each int list will be converted to an (int -&gt; int) list and therefore, the total list will be converted into an (int -&gt; int) list list.  \n",

When I don't update preview, everything seems to be functioning fine. Why exactly do I need to update repaint for preview if the preview feature works fine without the update to repaint? \n",
      " Shortened Question:  \n",
      " Answer: Repaint is the function that tells the paint program how exactly to \"paint\" that widget. Preview is the ability to see what the line/shape/etc. looks like before you release the mouse and it gets set on the canvas. Repaint is continually called while you're previewing things. In that sense, the canvas is being updated. What specifically do you mean by \"updating\" preview and repaint?  \n",
