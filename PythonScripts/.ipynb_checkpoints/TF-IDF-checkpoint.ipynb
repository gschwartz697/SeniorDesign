My issue is that because there are two nodes each with two children, I have to call the helper function twice (once on the first node's children and once on the second node's children) in order to reach all the branches in the tree.

      "Several answers to posts on Piazza indicated that when the tree consists of only a leaf, we should return 0 because there is no parent to match with. However, I am confused about how this case affects a tree of nodes and leaves, since we still must recurse down to the base case in order to compare that leaf with its parent. That causes an invalid input, since the functions needed to compare hamming distance require an input of helix. I am getting an error because of this. Should I be considering the base case to pertain to the node instead of leaf? If so, how can I know that the node I am dealing with has no further nodes (ie its children are leaves)?\n",

I intended to be responsible and take the late penalties in place in the class until my symptoms peaked Friday afternoon into the evening.  At that point I was working on Problem 6 in the homework but was having some compilation errors.  I could not get the file to compile when I tried to submit it before the final deadline and my symptoms got so bad I had to put down the computer and rest before I could comment out the necessary lines to at least receive some partial credit.  I understand the course policies would imply that I should receive a zero for this assignment and I understand if that is the case.  I was mainly reaching out to see if there exist any measures I can take to help mitigate the harm to my grade from this mishap as I continue to work through these new complications of my past injuries.\n",

Since 42 is an int, and it is the first argument, it will take the place of the first 'a, so that we're left with 'b -&gt; 'a.

There are so many different steps to the instructions that I'm not sure if I'm understanding a part wrong or if I'm just implementing it wrong. I start by making a Pixel[][] that takes in pic.getBitmap(). I then have a nested for loop that goes till the width and height of the pic, make a pixel at each x and y, and have r, g, b values that I believe are summing up the r g b values of each pixel (I did r =+p.getRed()) . I then took the average by using the method of rounding and casting to an int and doing (r+g+b) / (3.0 * w * h). I then make new r g b values which are p.getRed() etc - avg. I then declare new scaled r g b values by using the new r g b values ( the ones that have avg subtracted), multiplying by the multiplier, and using the round and casting to an int method. I then take these newest r g b values and add the avg back. Sorry for writing t all out, but like I said I can't understand if I'm understanding the instructions wrong or just implementing it wrong and I've been going through it for a while!

Essentially, my submissions were not compiling because of the PixelPicture class. Because the submission files did not include a PixelPicture class, we were extremely confused about how to submit. This, in conjunction with the Codio errors that forced me to work on a separate IDE, took away a lot of time from actually working on the assignment. We tried for hours to submit, and it finally started working around 1AM. I was submitting the same document every time (long before 12AM).

I see why this might work for the current scenario (and have done this in my code), because int is a primitive and Strings are immutable. However, for a general situation, where the members of a collection are general  objects, just copying them over to the new collection would return a shallow copy which contains the references of the objects. Hence, changing the new collection would also change the original one. I think what we would want in a general solution is the creation of a deep copy, which copies every member not by reference, but by creating new members and copying the fields to ensure that only primitives are copied, not reference. If I'm not mistaken, for TreeMap, the functions clone() and putAll() both create shallow copies of the original map.

This is not the case (at least not the only issue) because the issue still persists if the only thing I change is the preferred size of the GameCourt (i.e. the size of the objects stays the same relative to the screen, but the GameCourt JPanel appeared larger).  I also do not have any calculations based on the preferred size of the GameCourt JPanel.  I am extremely confused why only changing the preferred size of the game court would affect the velocity of objects.  Thanks for any ideas.\n",

For pacman, the pacman will move by user control and the user will only be allowed to change direction if the pacman is at a position s.t. there will be a path to go if the direction was changed at that particular location.

When called, Nuke uses recursion to draw a Vicsek fractal of walls across the middle of the board. Just like any other wall, if a player crashes into any of these walls, they lose. To draw the fractal, Nuke first draws a cross across the center of the board of radius R. Then, at each of the four corners of the cross, Nuke calls itself again, drawing another cross of radius R/2. This continues until R is sufficiently small, and produces a pattern like the one shown in green below.\n",

This is needed in order to allow for situations where the user's actions and the game's response to the actions are different, and cannot really be done by a single class as each mode differs largely. Each class behaves very differently from the other classes extending gamemode, as each class not only has its own way of drawing out the game and checks for different user inputs, but also interact with different other classes - as in my gamemode class uses animation and level classes to generate the world, while my menu map interacts with a background class to generate itself.
