Would it be appropriate to understand the references as sort of a mutable local variable in Java? Essentially, whenever I make a value controller and update it by changing it or adding listeners, will the value controller continue to have the value reference and the listeners reference to store the data? And would I just be mutating the references to store different information? I was a bit unsure as I am making the value and listeners as sort of \"local\" but I think it would make more sense to make the part of the record to be \"inherent\" to the controller. \n",

      "> 16.085855\tSo, a drop-down menu will just be a widget in widget.ml (using functions from gctx.ml). I can use it in paint to choose between different types of dotted lines. I don't think I will animate the drop-down, its repaint method will be based on a boolean value that tells whether the menu is open or not. Although I do see that this is very similar to a radio button apart from the fact that it saves space. I see the implementation as pretty challenging too as it might require two value controllers (one for which option in the menu is chosen and another for whether the menu is open or not) and I would also have to consider the situation when the drop-down is \"above\" some other features, so I'll attempt radio buttons and sliders first and then implement this if I have time. \n",

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n"

      "> 17.720917\tI'm on question 6 and I have created a slider for the thickness. Like the instructions suggested the slider will only adjust the thickness of the line if the thick checkbox is checked. However I have encountered one little issue that I am not sure if I need to fix: when I check the thick checkbox, I have a default thick value; if the slider is adjusted before I check the checkbox, the lines are drawn with the default thick value instead of the slider thick value. Is this ok? It only works if you adjust the slider after you check the checkbox. \n",

Say, I check the checkbox and then move the slider to some value that is not 30, for example, 48. Then I uncheck the checkbox and then check it again. Should the thickness pick up where it left off at (48) or is it ok for it to default back to 30 even though that's not where the slider is currently at?\n",

So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

I see the implementation as pretty challenging too as it might require two value controllers (one for which option in the menu is chosen and another for whether the menu is open or not) and I would also have to consider the situation when the drop-down is \"above\" some other features, so I'll attempt radio buttons and sliders first and then implement this if I have time. \n",

The button and canvas widgets don't really deal with either aspects (they return a widget*label_controller*notifier_controller and widget * notifier_controller respectively), and therefore paint and gctx deal with the drawing/handling of the widget. Since checkbox takes in a string, we can add a label to it. But it doesn't have the functionality to draw itself, nor does it return a notifier_controller for the event handling. So how can we make the checkbox widget draw itself and handle an event?\n",

So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n"

      "Hello! I wrote a bit of code and it passes the tests. However, I just wanted to be sure that I understood what was going on. Would it be appropriate to understand the references as sort of a mutable local variable in Java? Essentially, whenever I make a value controller and update it by changing it or adding listeners, will the value controller continue to have the value reference and the listeners reference to store the data? And would I just be mutating the references to store different information? I was a bit unsure as I am making the value and listeners as sort of \"local\" but I think it would make more sense to make the part of the record to be \"inherent\" to the controller. \n",

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

      "Hello! I wrote a bit of code and it passes the tests. However, I just wanted to be sure that I understood what was going on. Would it be appropriate to understand the references as sort of a mutable local variable in Java? Essentially, whenever I make a value controller and update it by changing it or adding listeners, will the value controller continue to have the value reference and the listeners reference to store the data? And would I just be mutating the references to store different information? I was a bit unsure as I am making the value and listeners as sort of \"local\" but I think it would make more sense to make the part of the record to be \"inherent\" to the controller. \n",

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

I see the implementation as pretty challenging too as it might require two value controllers (one for which option in the menu is chosen and another for whether the menu is open or not) and I would also have to consider the situation when the drop-down is \"above\" some other features, so I'll attempt radio buttons and sliders first and then implement this if I have time. \n",

So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n"

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n"

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n"

Although I do see that this is very similar to a radio button apart from the fact that it saves space. I see the implementation as pretty challenging too as it might require two value controllers (one for which option in the menu is chosen and another for whether the menu is open or not) and I would also have to consider the situation when the drop-down is \"above\" some other features, so I'll attempt radio buttons and sliders first and then implement this if I have time. \n",

So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller.

      "> 17.883026\tI'm changing this to private because it is about my specific implementation. So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

I am still a bit confused about the implementation for the handle function though: Since we are using hpair for the label, a spacer, and the actual box, by the very nature of hpair, shouldn't it do nothing when we click on the space between them?

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

Although I do see that this is very similar to a radio button apart from the fact that it saves space. I see the implementation as pretty challenging too as it might require two value controllers (one for which option in the menu is chosen and another for whether the menu is open or not) and I would also have to consider the situation when the drop-down is \"above\" some other features, so I'll attempt radio buttons and sliders first and then implement this if I have time. \n",

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).

      "> 17.79835\tI'm changing this to private because it is about my specific implementation. So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?\n",

I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer).
