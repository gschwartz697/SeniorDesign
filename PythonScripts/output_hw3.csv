My current understanding of this homework is that our program is supposed to ask the user which question they want to answer and then print out the answers to that question. Why is taking in the italicized input necessary?,"I'm a little confused with this line in the hw: ""Describe in detail the algorithm you used for each question"". For most of the questions, I'm not really using an algorithm per say to get the answer. I'm mostly just finding elements by their tag (e.g. table) and iterating through sub-elements (e.g. rows) to get what I want. Does that mean I'm perhaps not doing the assignment correctly since I'm not using algorithms to get my answer?","Two questions:

1) Would it be possible to see expected behavior/output for the example inputs given in the homework specs? I would like to write tests against these examples without finding all the results by hand, if possible.

2) For question 4, for the input king, there is a case where the role is ""Stephen Hawking"" which technically contains the string ""king"" - should this be included in the list of results? Or are we looking specifically for the role King, and thus this element should be excluded? Also, should our lookups be case-sensitive (that is, King and king are 2 different searches)?

I have managed to select the table in the photo above.
Then i use select(""tr"") and i get all the rows, and when I check the size of Elements of tr it is 13 which is correct. 
Bu then when I iterate through the &lt;tr&gt;s, I try to use select(""td""), but every time i get the size of that to be zero. ","For the hw I have accessed tables by the .select(""table"").get(some_integer) method, but for "".get"" I hardcode an actual number that I got from figuring out what table Im trying to extract data from. is this okay?"
"In the writeup, it says :



The class should ask the user which question they want to answer 

Should we allow the user to pass in the number as an argument in main? Or is it sufficient to answer all the questions in Main and just separate them by section?

"When I use the URLGetter and URLTester code from class on the Academy Award Portal website, it is able to pull all of the contents from the page, but when I use the same exact code on a different Wikipedia page (e.g. Best Animated Feature or Best Original Screenplay), it seems to only pull a portion of the contents at the end of the page.

When getting contents from the Portal page, I get the HTML header at the start:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html class=""client-nojs"" lang=""en"" dir=""ltr""&gt;&lt;head&gt;

But for the other pages, it starts with:
&lt;li id=""cite_note-10""&gt;&lt;span class=""mw-cite-backlink""&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=""#cite_ref-10""&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=""reference-text""&gt;...... etc.
I'm using the same exact code and only replacing the URL, so not sure what could be causing this?","I am able to parse the tables on the Wikipedia page but when I get to the final column that I need information from, I'm not sure how to identify the URL and use that using JSoup. How would I do that?","Is it valid to assume that when looking for the link to the Best Animated Feature page, the URL will contain ""Best"" ""Animate"" and ""Feature"" ?"
"For question 3, I am able to find the header that contains 1980s. However, I need the table that comes right after this header. I've tried using after() as well as next(), but those return siblings rather than the next line. Is there a way to find the next table?","In the instruction, it says italicized parts should be able to be replaced by similar inputs. For question 5, can we assume that the input wth be 4 or greater since directors with 4 nominations or more are all listed in a separate table at the bottom of the page? Or do we have to account for numbers less that 4 and thus, have to parse the main table?","I noticed that within the Best Documentary Feature page, there are time periods with a table and others that don't. 
For example, the list of movies for 1980's is stored within a table, and 1940's is not.
Do we need to handle each case or is it reasonable to assume that the data will always be in a table format?"
"For Q1, are we assuming the user can input any award category, or will it always be Best Animated Feature? Not sure since it's not italicized.","For questions in which the award is italicized, such as ""Best Documentary Feature"" in #3 or ""Best Picture"" in #6, is it okay to assume that the user will input the link to the Wikipedia page? "
"For this question, best documentary feature is italicized, does this mean we should be able to return this for other categories? or is this only ever going to be best documentary feature?","For this question, best documentary feature is italicized, does this mean we should be able to return this for other categories? or is this only ever going to be best documentary feature?"
"Will we be expected to handle this?

"I'm feeling very confused about properly using regex to parse through the Wikipedia HTML. It's not that I don't understand what it is or how to use it, but how can we analyze multiple lines at a time? For example, for the first programming problem, sometimes that section of HTML will have 2 numbers, one preceeded by ""rowspace"" to indicate that it also account for the next company. This seems relatively irregular to me--how are we supposed to account for that? In addition, the numbers come BEFORE their corresponding company. If we want to associate the two, how can we ""back up"" lines to know what goes with what? Any tips would be greatly appreciated.","If we're using JSoup to look at the links on the wikipedia portal, is it considered hardcoding to have code like
""link.endsWith(""Category:Academy_Awards"")"", in order to navigate to the correct next page towards the answer? Or should we be matching somehow more generically? I don't see an obvious other way to do the navigation, but this seems inefficient since it implies I already know the exact link to go to.
Thanks!!","I understand that we aren't hardcoding in case Wikipedia changes any URL's. However, can we assume that each Wikipedia page's overall format/structure (i.e. table format, table headings, etc...) won't change? ie. For Best Animated Feature, can we code our program to directly collect data from the ""Studio Breakdown"" table?","Hi, I'm trying to complete question 3 using jsoup, but I'm having a lot of trouble getting the code to work. There are a lot of attributes such as bold, text box color, etc. but I can't figure out what jsoup function to use to filter those out. Is there any direction I should be looking in? I know it's not a tag or a contains text."
"For question 7, there are some actors that don't have a table containing their basic information (specifically, their birth year). If they don't have this table, we would have to find their birth year by sorting through the lines on the page. Can we hardcode their birth year instead (ie in the case of Laurence Olivier)?","Is it okay to hardcode characteristics of tables? For example, in question 1, each nomination number doesn't correspond to just 1 company in the Studio Breakdown table. In the cases where it corresponds to 2 companies, can I hardcode how to get the company names for that specific nomination number? In some cases, it corresponds to 2. I'm not sure how to generalize this."

"Hi! I stopped into Allison's OH today with this question and was told to post on Piazza. For question 6, I am looping through each winning movie title and trying to go to that movie's individual page in order to find box office sales. When encountering a URL with an apostrophe, something happens where the method is changing the URL to one that does not exist and thus the program cannot navigate to the correct URL.

For example:

Document newFilmDoc = Jsoup.connect(""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can%27t_Take_It_with_You_(film)"").get();

gives the error:

Exception in thread ""main"" org.jsoup.HttpStatusException: HTTP error fetching URL. Status=400, URL=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can%2527t_Take_It_with_You_(film)

This happens with any movie with an apostrophe - the ""%27"" in place of the apostrophe gets changed into ""%2527"" and thus the URL cannot be found. I am not sure why this is happening or what to do other than to hardcode to account for this situation.
