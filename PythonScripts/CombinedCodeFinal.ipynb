It's not that I don't understand what it is or how to use it, but how can we analyze multiple lines at a time?

This seems relatively irregular to me--how are we supposed to account for that? In addition, the numbers come BEFORE their corresponding company. If we want to associate the two, how can we \"back up\" lines to know what goes with what? Any tips would be greatly appreciated. \n",

I was going to compare that value with the average shortest path length between all products and the product with the best sales rank. However, my runtime is horrible and I can't figure out how to improve it. I've tested the code on small inputs (~30 products) and it works, but it's been running for 12.5hrs and it's only calculated ~5,000 shortest paths. Do you have any advice? I've attached my code for Dijkstra's, in case that helps. My underlying graph is a HashMap, so lookup is constant, and my Item objects store neighbors in HashMaps as well.

      "Noor Salman, the wife of the killer who opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last summer, will be able to leave jail within days ahead of her trial on charges of helping carry out the massacre, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled Wednesday.\n",
      "MURDER SUSPECT ALEX DEATON CAUGHT AFTER MULTI-STATE MANHUNT\n",
      "In announcing her decision, U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu said Salman, 31, was not a danger to the public and had no credible connections to the Islamic State terror group -- which the prosecution strongly disputed. Salman will have to remain in jail for at least two days, giving the feds time to appeal.\n",
      "Her husband, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to several terror groups during the shooting that killed 49 people in June of last year before police killed him. After the attack, Salman moved from Orlando to her mother's home in Rodeo, outside San Francisco, where she was arrested in January.\n",
      "FACE-BITING SUSPECT'S APOLOGY IS 'ELABORATE LIE,' VICTIM'S SON SAYS\n",
      "Salman drove her husband to the nightclub at least once before the attack, a law enforcement source told Fox News. It also emerged that she shopped with Mateen at a Walmart the night before the attack, when he stocked up on ammo.\n",
      "Noor Salman, seen wearing red, with relatives and attorneys. (Sketch artist Vicki Behringer)\n",
      "In addition, the couple texted each other during the massacre, investigators said. Mateen reportedly asked his wife, \"Do you see what's happening?\" She was said to have replied, \"No?\", as Mateen responded, \"I love you, babe.\"\n",
      "Salman failed four lie detector tests before she faced charges, a source close to the invesigation added.\n",
      "The judge said Salman would have to wear an electronic ankle monitor while she lives with her uncle in Northern California.\n",
      "\"She wants to be home,\" defense attorney Linda Moreno told reporters outside court on Wednesday. \"She wants to see her son,\" attorney Charles Swift added.\n",
      "Salman's mother and uncle put up their houses to guarantee that Salman would not escape. Ryu called the conditions of Salman's release \"essentially house arrest,\" because she can leave only for court appearances, meetings with her local attorneys and doctor's appointments.\n",
      "Salman has pleaded not guilty to charges of aiding and abetting Mateen and lying to investigators after the shooting. A trial has not been scheduled.\n",
      "Salman initially said she didn't know anything about the attack but later told investigators Mateen abused steroids, was \"pumped up\" on the night of the attack and said \"this is the one day\" as he walked out the door, federal prosecutor Sara Sweeney has said in court.\n",
      "Sweeney also said the couple ran up $25,000 in credit card debt and spent $5,000 in cash in the days before the shooting. Among the purchases was an $8,000 diamond ring for Salman. In addition, they made Salman the death beneficiary of his bank account, prosecutors said.\n",
      "Swift said outside court earlier this month that Salman made those statements without a lawyer present during an 18-hour interrogation immediately after the attack.\n",

      "A federal judge in California declined Wednesday to release the wife of the man who killed dozens of people at a Florida nightclub and ordered a psychiatric evaluation after prosecutors said she accompanied her husband on scouting trips for potential targets.\n",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu in Oakland said she wanted a psychiatric evaluation done of Noor Salman, 31, before deciding whether to release her from jail pending a trial on charges of supporting her husband's attack and then lying to investigators about it. Salmon has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n",
      "Salman was arrested by federal authorities last month at her mother's home in suburban San Francisco, where she moved with her 4-year-old son after her husband Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Mateen pledged allegiance to several terror organizations, including ISIS, during the attack before police shot and killed him.\n",
      "Federal prosecutor Sara Sweeney divulged some details of the allegations for the first time in court Wednesday while arguing against the release of Salman. Sweeney said Mateen asked Salman about \"what would make more people upset an attack at downtown Disney, or at a club?\"\n",
      "In addition to accompanying her husband on scouting trips, Salman watched him leave their apartment with a gun and a backpack full of ammunition on the night of the shooting, Sweeney said.\n",
      "Authorities say Salman initially said she didn't know anything about the attack but later told investigators Mateen abused steroids, was \"pumped up\" on the night of the attack, and said \"this is the one day\" as he walked out the door, Sweeney said in court. \"I knew when he left he was going to commit the attack,\" Sweeney said Salman told investigators.\n",
      "Sweeney also told the court the couple ran up $25,000 in credit card debt and spent $5,000 in cash in the days before the shooting. Among the purchases was an $8,000 diamond ring for Salman. In addition, Mateen and Salman made her the death beneficiary of his bank account.\n",
      "Salman's attorney, Charles Swift, told reporters outside the court that Salman made those statements without a lawyer present during an 18-hour interrogation immediately after the attack, and that he hasn't yet received a transcript or recording of the interrogation to determine the context of her statements and accuracy of the allegations.\n",
      "Swift argued that prosecutors were charging Salman with the crimes of her husband. Mateen physically abused Salman, according to Swift, and never told her about his plans to carry out the killings. Her defense team told the court she was a special education student and couldn't concort a plan.\n",
      "Swift pointed out that Mateen was a security guard and left the couple's home hundreds of times with a gun and ammunition. In addition, the defense claimed Mateen watched ISIS videos with his son, and was \"bulked up\" due to being on steroids at the time of the shooting.\n",
      "It was the first time Salman's legal team heard details of the allegations. \"We frankly expected more,\" attorney Linda Moreno said outside court.\n",
      "Salman's mother and uncle have pledged to put up their homes as collateral to secure her release from jail pending trial. Federal prosecutors are seeking to transfer Salman to Florida to face the charges that could bring a sentence of life in prison.\n",

      " Shortened Question: someone random surfer model functions within context basic pagerank rule  \n",
      " Answer: The random surfer model solves certain issues with the basic pagerank rule such as sinks in the network receiving all of the rank.  It gives small, equal, probability to each page that a user will navigate directly to it (without using the links defined in the network) and assigns rank proportional to those probabilities to each node, the rest of the rank is distributed proportional to 1 - the probability of the surfer navigating to a random page according to the basic page rank rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is to say, if some node $n$ were to have rank $r$ according to the basic pagerank rule at a certain round of updating, the node would instead have rank $\\epsilon \\frac{1}{n} + (1 - \\epsilon)r$ where $0 \\leq epsilon \\leq 1$ is the probability of a user choosing a random page.  Notice that setting $\\epsilon$ to 0 we get the same rank we would have using the basic pagerank rule since there is no chance of surfing to a random page. \n",
