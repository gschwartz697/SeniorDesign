      " Answer: A Set (in general) has no duplicate elements and is unordered. What this means is that if I construct a set by adding 1, then 2, then 2, and then 1, I get an equivalent set to adding 2 and then 1 (to the empty set in both cases). However, when we are actually implementing a set, we can represent them in a number of different ways. One way would be to simply use a list and remove duplicates. This would make certain operations easier, like add (just look through the list and see if the element is there, and if not, add it), but it would make other operations hard to implement, like equals. In this HW, we are representing sets as sorted lists, which helps us implement certain functions.\n",

      "There is a problem in hw4, I believe, that asks about structural versus referential equality, and understanding what EXACTLY the references are pointing to will help you solve that problem. In the example I gave above, q = n (structural), and q == n (referential). Furthermore, m = n (structural), but m DOES NOT == n (referential) because they are pointing to DIFFERENT Some bubbles, which are stored in the computer as different locations in the heap. For this same reason, m = q (structural), but m DOES NOT == q (referential). Remember that the Some bubble is actually shorthand for the Some \"box\" that goes on the heap that in turn has a reference to the value inside the Some. If you have two items that are pointing to different Some boxes, they are DEFINITELY NOT referentially equal. Items that are structurally equal are \"automatically\" referentially equal, but it does not necessarily go the other way.

      " Answer: That's part of it! There are 2 main differences between tail recursion and regular recursion. The first is that we can use constant stack space because we don't need to remember the previous recursive calls and where we were. The only thing we return at each step of the function is another call to loop, so Ocaml will optimize this by popping the function call off the stack, because we don't need to remember it. Therefore, we only use constant stack space.\n",

      "The other difference is the order in which we are evaluating things. Notice that in tail recursion, by the time we get to the end of the list or queue, we have our answer, so we accumulate our answer as we go along, from head to tail. Using regular recursion, we don't start computing anything until we reach the base case, and then we end up evaluating backwards, from the tail to the head. \n",

      "So now let's look at fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt; x::y), knowing that x : 'a, y : 'a list, and (fun y -&gt; x::y) : ('a list -&gt; 'a list).  fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt; x::y) takes in x and returns (fun y -&gt; x::y).  Therefore we know its type is 'a -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list.\n",

The moral here is that it doesn't matter if the function is anonymous, what matters is that it's the right type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, sometimes we don't explicitly specify the types when we define anonymous functions, e.g. fold (fun x acc -&gt; ...) ... That's valid code, but I didn't say what x and acc have to be. So, now this becomes a problem of type inference. I.e. can we figure out the type of x and acc by looking at (in this case) 1) the definition of fold 2) the other inputs we pass fold and 3) the body of the anonymous function? Here's some examples to show how we do that:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) If I pass to fold a list of ints, then x must be an int. I know because in fold's def, the list input is a 'a list, and combine is 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b. So, an int list means all 'a values are ints.\n",
      "(2) With a function fun x -&gt; x + 1. That's valid OCaml, and x must be type int for the expression to type check because + requires to ints\n",
      "(3) If I pass fold fun x acc -&gt; x + acc again due to the definition of +, I know that x and acc both must be ints for it to type check. Now, that gives me a lot of info since combine is 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b (i.e. I could've written fun (x: 'a) (acc: 'b) : 'b = x + acc but we don't need to) and we know x is an int and acc is an int, so we know all throughout a call to fold involving this function, 'a and 'b are both int. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on, f x on the other hand would not type check because f expects as its first argument a 'a -&gt; 'a value, not a 'a value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's say we have let j (a: 'a) (b: 'a) : 'a = ... Now, j x is a valid partial application because j's type is 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a. And, j x has the type 'a -&gt; 'a.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the key with understanding function types is that every function can essentially be viewed as T1 -&gt; T2 where it takes T1 as an arg and returns T2. For f, T1 is 'a -&gt; 'a and T2 is 'a -&gt; unit. For h, T1 is 'a and T2 is 'a. For j, T1 is 'a and T2 is 'a -&gt; 'a. If you get that, you're in great shape. From that, you can also see that every function application where you pass it multiple arguments as once, e.g. add 1 2 is executed as a series of partial function applications where OCaml does add 1 2 ==&gt; aFuncThatAdds1ToItsArg 2 ==&gt; 3\n",

      " Shortened Question: h    sum  xy transform  transform sum           \n",
      " Answer: It is useful to proceed in a very careful manner with these questions. Here is the information we have so far: sum is a function that takes in 2 int arguments and transform is a function that takes in 2 arguments, one is a function and the other is a list. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now lets move from inwards out. We see that the function transform is taking in is transform sum. Note that here both transform and sum are partially applied. Consider only the inner transform for now. The function passed in is sum. Since sum takes in 2 arguments, applying sum to one integer argument would be partial application, and it would result in an int -&gt; int function. \n",
      "\n",
      "We know that the second argument to the inner transform has to be a list, and since sum is applied on it, it has to be an int list. Therefore, if transform sum is being called on an int list, and the int list is one element of the actual list, we have that the type of the actual list is int list list. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we know that transform sum transforms a list from an int list to an (int -&gt; int) list. Therefore, we know that each int list will be converted to an (int -&gt; int) list and therefore, the total list will be converted into an (int -&gt; int) list list.  \n",

The \"bottom-left-origin\" system is the one that you're most familiar with in Math, where x and y both start from 0, x increases to the right, and y increases to the top. The \"widget-local top-left-origin\" system is a system that's frequently used in graphics systems.

      " Answer: There is no fixed curve for this class and, in particular, (unlike some other schools or courses), we don't curve down in this class. We feel that CIS 120 is challenging enough with the homework assignments and exams that having a forced curve down would be too mean and not reflect what everyone has learnt throughout the semester.\n",

      "\n",
      "What this means is that if you calculate your weighted average based on the percentages on the CIS 120 website, that'll be the lowest grade you can get. The curve, if there is any, will only benefit you. We also don't have a fixed median grade for this class - it's typically in the high B range, but it changes from semester to semester and it could be higher or lower depending on how everyone's grades are this Fall.\n",

      "My next idea is to make the widget have a value controller that holds a number from 0-255 depending on the location of the mouse. Then I would create a mutable type in paint.ml that was of the same form as the type of color and could update.

      " Answer: (1)  You could make the color type mutable, but you shouldn't need to.  Instead of \"changing\" the color every time (which would require mutability), you can simply set Paint.color to a new color (not needing mutability (in Paint)).  Furthermore, we have asked you not to change the type definitions of any types or functions we give you, so you probably shouldn't change the type of color!\n",

      "Hello! I wrote a bit of code and it passes the tests. However, I just wanted to be sure that I understood what was going on. Would it be appropriate to understand the references as sort of a mutable local variable in Java? Essentially, whenever I make a value controller and update it by changing it or adding listeners, will the value controller continue to have the value reference and the listeners reference to store the data? And would I just be mutating the references to store different information?

      " Answer: OCaml and Java treat values a bit differently. By default in OCaml, every value in OCaml is immutable. In Java, every value is mutable. \n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of enclosing a piece of local state such that it is only accessible to the functions that operate on that function (i.e. a closure) is to help with encapsulation/protect it from being randomly altered. It is similar in idea to having a private variable in a class in Java. With a private variable in a class, you would have to write getters/setters in order to access that variable from outside the class. But when you are inside that class, you can access the private variable however you want. Similarly, in OCaml (and your make_control), you can't access value directly, but have to set/get it using add_change_listener, get_value, and change_value.\n",

      "There are some more examples of how closures look in the ASM in the recitation worksheets, but every time you call make_control, you initialize value, listeners, add_change_listener, etc. in the heap. Every time you call make_control, it initializes a new set of those records/functions in the heap. When you call one of the functions, it potentially changes that state in the heap and yup, you are just mutating the references and updating that information.\n",

The value of a thick line for me is 30, which is whenever the checkbox is checked. My slider has a max value of 60. Say, I check the checkbox and then move the slider to some value that is not 30, for example, 48. Then I uncheck the checkbox and then check it again. Should the thickness pick up where it left off at (48) or is it ok for it to default back to 30 even though that's not where the slider is currently at? \n",

These functions can be used in the handle function of a widget, which has the same type. So in the handle function for your checkbox, you will have to use an event_listener, either explicitly or implicitly. However, for a checkbox, there are 2 main items to deal with: you want to change the state of the checkbox (clicked/not clicked) on a certain event (mouseclick), and you want to run whatever functions are in your list of change_listeners whenever the state of the checkbox changes. \n",

All of the functionality of the slider should be written in widget.ml, and the only thing you should do in paint.ml is creating the sliders and adding the appropriate functions to make them change the color. Also, you should not store the redundant state of r1, b1, and g1. You already have the current color stored, and these might get out of sync. \n",

      " Answer: At a high level, the 'a buffered type is allowing us to view what the next element of the stream and still have access to it without advancing the stream. This is what the \"peek\" method of the buffered type is doing. Notice this function returns a tuple of a ’a stream and a ’a buffered.\n",

      "For (1), When produce is actually called, we want to advance the value stored in the buffer forward by one and update the state appropriately. We couldn't update the 'a buffered's state if we did not rewrite the produce function for the 'a stream we return. \n",

      "For your question (2), this does not compile. &lt;- can only be used with records. More generally, remember that buffered stores the next value in the stream. When produce is called, we want to return that \"next\" value since it has now been produced. We also want to update the buffered value to be the next one in the stream, which is why we let buf.contents &lt;- s.produce().\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure I understand your question (3). mk_buffered returns a tuple of a 'a stream and a 'a buffered. As defined, a 'a stream is a record with one field in it named produce, of type unit -&gt; 'a. A 'a buffered is a record with one field in it named peek, of type unit -&gt; 'a. In mk_buffered, we return this:\n",

You should try to figure out the best way to store all of this information so you are minimizing redundant state and can easily and efficiently implement all of the functions in ServerModel. To help you plan out your design, take a look at what functions you have to implement and try to think through how you would implement them with different ways of organizing your data. \n",

      " Answer: \"this\" is a keyword which refers to that instance. You've probably seen it mostly when it refers to that instance's class variables (e.g. this.something). This is needed when the name of the variable you pass into a function (e.g. the constructor) has the same name as the class variable. Otherwise, you generally don't need to use \"this\".\n",

      " Question: So I’m working in Eclipse and last night, I completed the final task so I zipped the required files (directly from Eclipse) and used my first submission (on the Codio Submission site) to see where I stand on the automatically graded tests. Unfortunately, there were some errors, as you can see in the screenshot I attached to this email. Aside from the fact that it didn’t like how I named my zip file, I also got a score of 23.0/80.0 based on tests, which surprised me since I had been passing all the initially given test. Although my code compiled (thus using up 1 of my 3 free submissions) the first error was listed as “User cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable” which leads me to believe that many of the other failures are simply because the User class I made did not implement the Comparable&lt;User&gt; interface (which I have since fixed). Since this submission basically just told me to implement that interface and was otherwise meaningless, would I be able to get an extra submission? \n",

      " Answer: The stack trace gives you the exact line that the null pointer exception is getting thrown at, so you should definitely utilize that! It looks like it is getting thrown at line 126 of ServerModel (inside of changeNickname). You don't have any line numbers in your screenshots -- but I would suggest going to that line and you know that something there must be null when its not supposed to be. That should give you a place to start debugging -- figure out why its null (when its not supposed to be) and then adjust for that. \n",

However, isWord is a static function (obviously for a reason), and I am just very stuck on what I should be altering in order to access this static function. Please let me know if I am just misunderstanding the constructor entirely. Thank you!\n",

Also, after every level you complete, you have the opportunity to wager a certain amount of coins in order to win a multiplier of that amount, so you can win coins or actually lose coins, but will make the likelihood greater that you win coins, but it will be implemented with a weighted randomness.\n",

Also take a look at the tick function --&gt; in the constructor, a Timer is set up to tick every few milliseconds, and the tick function is called. What happens in the tick step?

MVC can also apply to more specific components or functions of your game -- for example, having a function to draw the tile is something that's very gui/view related and is done by iterating through your tileMap. However, you may have another function in the same class that updates a Tile in the tileMap which is very controller/model based and doesn't require anything related to the gui/view. I just uploaded another example into the student accessible recitation materials drive (pokemon.zip) which might be helpful.\n",

      " Question: I'm interested in implementing Pac-man for my final homework assignment but I am having some trouble conceptualizing the model of the game-state. Pac-man works with a grid system so it seems only intuitive that I use a 2D array to help with my modelling. Here's what I've managed to work out so far:\n",
      "1) I have a 2D array wherein each element in the array represented a piece of the game board. I'm thinking of filling the 2D array with ints such that each int represents something different within the gameboard environment (i.e. 0's represent a wall). \n",
      "\n",
      "2) I create a JPanel and set its layout to have the same dimensions as my 2D array. The JPanel will have access to my 2D array, so I will then loop through every element of the 2D array and will decide what to populate the next \"section\" of the JPanel grid with based on the int in the corresponding element of the 2D array. This distinction between the 2D array and the JPanel grid allows for the introduction of multiple levels if I so choose to implement that.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Here's where I get stuck: it seems intuitive to represent the walls and floor of the game board using ints in a 2D array, but I am unsure how to represent the location of my living objects (Pac-man and the ghosts).

I can't simply rely on traditional x-y coordinates because Pac-man and the ghosts move in a quantized fashion.

      " Answer: Your intuition with the 2-D array and making Pac-man into its own object is definitely on the right track. You can have methods for Pac-man that move him 1 unit to the top / bottom / left / right based on the user key input. You can still use \"coordinates\" to represent the location of the Pac-man, like the [row][col] indices that he is in; the only downside to this is that pacman would move in \"jumps\" and not have \"continuous\" motion. Every time the user clicks on a key, you first move the pacman and then you could have a method inside where you keep track of the main game state to update the array with the new location of pacman (and set the original position back to \"default\" or \"eaten point\" or what you want that position to be). \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you could just NOT put pacman into the array, have him as another object that \"floats on top\" of the main game board (so that the array only contains the walls and foods) and then check for intersection with items in the array. This would allow you to make pacman have continuous motion, but might be more difficult to implement.\n",

      "Thanks! \n",
      " Shortened Question: hello  looking pokemon  drive  wondering drawing background image  grass  tile constructor  provide better functionality   \n",
      " Answer: Yup, that's the idea!  Since we know we want to draw every background tile the same way and we know our gameboard will be an array of background or item tiles, we modularize our code by writing our draw method for the background tile into the Tile class.  Now every time we want to draw the gameboard, we can easily iterate through the array and call each individual array element's draw method.  And this simplifies our code in the Game class even further - all we need to do when the game state changes is call the draw method of the gameboard to redraw every tile on the GUI.  \n",
      "\n",
      "(Modularizing our code means to break it into small, usable chunks (modules) that we can use flexibly when necessary.  One classic example of modules are classes in Java.  Instead of having thousands of lines of code in one main() method, we break our code into classes that we can use and reuse flexibly as the need arises.  We may not need to reuse the Tile class very often outside our pokemon game, but having the draw method in the Tile class is useful because it simplifies the draw method in the GameBoard class and in the Game class.) \n",

      " Question: I am building Othello. My strategy is to accumulate a set of pairs of ints (x, y), which represent the coordinates of the tokens to be flipped, and then to iterate through the set and flip the token at each Pair of coordinates. I created a Pair class to hold these two ints. Initially, I was getting a Class Cast Exception when I tried to add a new Pair to the TreeSet&lt;Pair&gt;, and the error message said it was because Pair doesn't implement Comparable. I didn't think the ability to compare one Pair to another was critical to my program so I used @Override to insert a dummy compareTo method that always returns zero. Now, when I run the whole program, it only ever flips the first token added to the set, and I'm wondering if this is because it cannot compare the Pairs. If so, where can I find a model for writing a good compareTo function or what other ways might I be able to get around this issue? Thank you! \n",

Upon a keyboard click, there is a move() method that gets Pacman to move in the designated direction until he hits a wall but he is redrawn rather instantaneously as if already appearing at the edge of the wall. I think this occurs since his move() method changes his location in the map in terms of x,y location, redrawing him at that desired position as well.

      " Answer: Unfortunately, I don't think this would count (at least would not receive full points). We ask for four particular features of chess (check, checkmate, castling, and en passant) in order for it to be fully counted for the complex game logic concept in addition to more standard and basic gameplay (movement and capturing of pieces) -- it sounds like a a good portion (at least the first half) of what you are describing is pretty core to scrabble even working as a game.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, for checking to see if a play is legal (I haven't really played scrabble in a long time), but you should generally be able to use your board (2D array?) to check if the newly formed word is valid in just the horizontal and vertical direction and is contiguous/not on top of an existing tile. This isn't particularly difficult if you use your array properly (though it might be a bit tedious). This perhaps simpler than chess since if any piece moves, you need to then check to see if that places the king into check by any other opposing piece (which has various movements that are not just horizontal/vertical) and prevent that move from occurring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dictionary I assume is going to be pretty similar to HW08.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't necessarily need to implement every single piece of scrabble for your game (just like chess also has additional rules that we allow students to ignore, especially if they do not chose complex game logic as a concept) -- just general/basic gameplay is enough. For example, you could potentially simplify the scoring a bit or not include the blank tiles in your game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also something from a TA who did implement scrabble for his game, which may help:\n",
      "The model update algorithm basically involves looking at the tiles played, making sure they’re all contiguous in one row/column, then extending at the front and back to get the whole word and score it, then check each perpendicular row/column to see if any new words are formed, make sure they’re in the dictionary too and score them.

      " Answer: A notifier controller is a list of event listeners. Basically, whenever there is an event within the widget, all of the event listeners run. A value controller, which you implemented for checkbox, only runs through the list of change listeners when the stored value is changed. So a notifier controller does something whenever there is an event in the widget, and a value controller only does something when change_value() is called, which may or may not be due to an event. \n",

Each new \"counter\" object has its own cnt field. The concept of closure simply means that we can preserve encapsulated state and use it across each individual object.

I am \" + getName() +\".\"); For this getName(), wouldn't dynamic dispatch mean you call getName for the class that is lowest on the class table which would be the Mimic class yielding \"Mimic Bob\"?
