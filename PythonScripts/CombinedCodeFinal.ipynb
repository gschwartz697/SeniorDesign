Im having trouble with the runtime of something like this, since were not completely cutting the array in half every time. Its more of a problem when the array size is even, since we'd only be cutting off $$\\frac{n}{2} - 1$$ elements so our recursion, in the worst case would be $$T(n) = T(\\frac{n}{2} + 1) + O(1)$$ if were performing constant time operations at every step, which i believe will come out to a upper bound linear run time even though were nearly halving the array every time.. How can I stengthen this? maybe by taking into account that after having a worst case cut of an even size array, we'd be left with an odd-size array that would always cut $$\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$$ and thus a better recursion, but I'm not sure how to deal with the changing change of the argument in the expansion of that runtime.
