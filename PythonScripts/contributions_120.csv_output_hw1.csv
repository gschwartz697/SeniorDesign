Can we assume that the input for the coins is going to an integer value?,"For the coins question, should we be planning to handle a negative input for amounts, or can we expect all inputs to be positive integers?"
"After doing some problems, I realized that there are some problems that do not need to be solved using recursion. However, the pre-existing format of the  homework looks like it used ""rec"" in each function. Do we have to try to make each of the functions recursive after we implement the test cases?","So I am facing a conceptual issue and visualizing the answer for the Kudos Question. I understand how to find the permutations for 2 element lists and 3 element lists but I do not understand how to do it for 4 and above. Even for 3, I was unable to use recursion.
This is my progress so far, and I was wondering if I could get any pointers to continue with? Also, are we allowed to use @ operator in the kudos problem?"
"In the two test cases that are provided to us, why do we not have to provide an expected output for the test? I have provided the example below. 

let test () : bool = not (exists [false; false]);; run_test ""exists all false"" test

Shouldn't it be 
let test () : bool = not (exists [false; false]) = false;; run_test ""exists all false"" test","Just to be clear, for the following test cases:

A) let test () : bool =
not (exists [false; false]);; run_test ""exists all false"" test

B)
let test () : bool = not (exists [false; true]);; run_test ""exists all false"" test

A would return true and B would return false for a properly implemented function because of the not operator?

"For the second part of number 8, what should the output be if the two lists are for example [""Mike""; ""Mike""; ""Bob""] and [""Mike""; ""Bill""; ""Alex""]? Should Mike repeat? ","I'm a little unclear on the instructions for problem 8 even after reading the faq page.  For example, if:

in_both [""Garnet""; ""Amethyst""; ""Pearl""] [""Pearl""; ""Steven""])

Then it should return

 [""Pearl""]
What if the string ""Pear"" appears twice in both lists? Or twice in the second list? Should it return [""Pearl Pear""]? If so, how should it be formatted?"
"Hi, I'm stuck on the int_join exercise and keep getting an error that the (bolded) tailend is of type int when it should be string. Can you please point me in the right direction?

I literally used used the same code from the join function. Any help is appreciated","When I try to call the recursive step, it throws the above error.

"For the join function, I am trying to handle the general recursive situation, the case of an empty list, and the case of the last item in the list (using """" as the separator) with pattern matching, but when I try to do this it keeps saying that I'm trying to append two empty lists. I know this is probably because I'm handling the second to last case and the last case and I probably only need to be handling two total cases, but I can't seem to figure this out. I was thinking of using an if statement in the general recursive part of the function, but I'm not really sure how to implement that in this instance.","For the pattern matching that I am using in the join function, I have the recursive call for the main case figured out, and I have the base case (empty list) figured out, but for the case of the last element in the list (which I do not want to be followed by a separator) I tried concatenating the term with the join function of """" and the remaining empty list, and I get the above error statement. I have tried all different outputs as well as if-then statements, but I feel like my code is on the right track, I just need to denote that the empty string I want to join for the last element in the list is the ""tail"" or the bade case not just some random empty list that I'm introducing. 

Does anyone have any suggestions that might help with this?"
"If it is explicitly stated in the comments that an input will only be x or y, do we still have to write failing test cases for invalid inputs y, z, etc?","In the instructions, it says that if we cannot compute the answer for whatever reason, we should return -1. Does this mean that if we have an empty list as a test case, it should return -1? "
