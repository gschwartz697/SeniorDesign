Since we can't access the head of the linkedlist from the node, I feel like this is an exception that should be taken care in LinkedListImpl.

      "I am having trouble understanding LinkedListNode.  I believe from CIS 110 when we made a linkedlist, we had two distinct classes: a linkedlist class and a node class.  The linkedlist class had a node field (normally labeled head) and maybe some other fields to simplify certain methods (such as size).  The node had a value field and a next node field.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assumed this was the structure as we were given a LinkedList interface and a LinkedListNode interface.  It appears that the LinkedList is already implemented and that we need to implement LinkedListNode.  However, in the LLN interface it says for add \"@return the head of the list with the element added\"\n",

      " Answer: It is supposed to be pointing to the head of the concatenated list. Since this function is recursive, every node in the first list makes a call to concatenate: If the list is 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 and you are concatenating it with 4 -&gt; 5, then you first call 1.concatenate(4 -&gt; 5) which then recursively calls 2.concatenate(4 -&gt; 5) which then calls 3.concatenate(4 -&gt; 5). That's why we say to return the head of the concatenated list. If we just said return a pointer to the node from which concatenate was called, there would be ambiguity.  \n",

I proceed to the next line of the doc if there is one and add the leftovers to that line and do the rechecking process. If the line contains fewer words than the max words, I grab words from the next line (and so on) until I reach max words number.

When we determined this not to be good enough, we argued that if we ran the code 10 times, forcibly terminating once the runtime had hit 10*n*lg(n), we could shrink that probability to 1/5^10. I don't really understand why this second method is a valid circumvention of the runtime problem.

      " Answer: Your answer is that $$T(b)=\\Theta(2^{b/2})$$, which is indeed super-polynomial in the number of bits. In reality, integers on a computer have fixed width, so that 0 and 1000000 are actually represented by the same number of bits, even though it is technically possible to represent 0 with 1 bit and 1000000 with $$\\lg(10000000)$$ bits. So you definitely raise a good point here. The idea of this problem wasn't really to go into the detail about bit-wise operations or representations. The main take-away should be that how you represent your input can drastically change how you evaluate the algorithm's performance. Here, if we just consider $$n$$ as a number, the runtime is (as you said) proportional to the square root of $$n$$, which seems pretty fast! But if we consider the bit representation of $$n$$, this runtime is terrible (super-polynomial, as you pointed out).  \n",

Then the mean of this distribution is very large, but the probability of being above the mean is a relatively small $$1/8$$ \n",

Doing so means that the original loop runs no less than our subset loop, meaning we can $$\\Omega$$ bound the original loop. A consequence of this is that when we choose a range for $$i$$, it bounds our choices of viable $$j$$s to the bounds declared by the second loop, $$1$$ to $$i^2$$.\n",

      " Question: For a D&amp;C algorithm on an array, say were selecting a pointer of an element nearest the center element and cutting the off part of the array to a side of the pointer in each step. so for an array of size 8: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, we could potentially have a pointer on element 5, and in the division step, we could shave off the elements strictly to the right of 5 and recurse on whats left: {1,2,3,4,5}, repeating, wed select the pointer to be the closed the the middle, which is 3, and would cut off one of the sides of three to yield an array with two elements. Im having trouble with the runtime of something like this, since were not completely cutting the array in half every time. Its more of a problem when the array size is even, since we'd only be cutting off $$\\frac{n}{2} - 1$$ elements so our recursion, in the worst case would be $$T(n) = T(\\frac{n}{2} + 1) + O(1)$$ if were performing constant time operations at every step, which i believe will come out to a upper bound linear run time even though were nearly halving the array every time.. How can I stengthen this? maybe by taking into account that after having a worst case cut of an even size array, we'd be left with an odd-size array that would always cut $$\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$$ and thus a better recursion, but I'm not sure how to deal with the changing change of the argument in the expansion of that runtime. Can we just say that the +1 round off in halving isn't effectual for large numbers? \n",

      " Answer: For your specific example, if you think about it, at each stage of the algorithm, adding one to the overall runtime will still add at most $$lgn$$ (because the recursion stops after $$lgn$$ levels), so the runtime will be at most $$n + lgn = O(n)$$. Additionally, if you following the analysis for quick select with the medians of medians algorithm, we can see that even if the partition is slightly off (e.g. $$T(n) = T(7n/10) + O(1)$$, you'll still end up with a linear algorithm  \n",

My point of confusion is why they set the ceiling to be less than/greater than the nearest integer bounds, which is mathematically a given anyway. I don't really understand why they set up that inequality rather than just subbing in for c and n0 right away to get the upper/lower bounds after you simplify the sum into polynomials.

      " Answer: Amortized analysis gives worst case runtimes over the course of a sequence of operations. You are right that some operations take a very long time, but the idea behind amortized analysis is that those costly operations are rare. Amortized analysis is used for when multiple operations are performed in a sequence and you care about the aggregate runtime: for example, with the stack operations, we were able to say that the worst case runtime of a series of $$n$$ pushes is $$O(n)$$, even though the worst case runtime for a single push is also $$O(n)$$. Amortized analysis gives a more practical runtime analysis for situations like these. \n",

      "\"Your algorithm for 4B is incorrect because there is nowhere to replace the word \"sorted\" with the word \"partitioned\". Your algorithm consists of only the following steps: 1. Find the mth smallest price using deterministic selection. 2. Add the first m elements of the array 3. Check if this sum is less than m^2. 4. Return the appropriate value if condition checked in 3 is true or not. I have read the algorithm description quite closely and it doesn't seem like you sort or partition the array. Thus, the algorithm is incorrect. Normally, since your algorithm is incorrect, no points would be awarded for correctness or runtime, however, I had previously given you the benefit of the doubt and awarded you points for runtime. To be consistent with the other graders, I will remove those points.\"\n",

      " Question: I'm not exactly sure how to determine if a node was created before/after another one. If we are comparing nodes $$a$$ and $$b$$ to see which was created first, we'd only do this if $$a$$ and $$b$$ had equal frequencies (frequency for a non-leaf is defined as the sum of frequencies of the left and right children). Therefore, it seems likely that if $$a$$ has a larger height than $$b$$, it was probably created before $$b$$. However, this breaks down when one of them is a leaf node, as the leaves are created first. Is this on the right track? Or, is creation time more related to the number of children who are leaves? \n",

This can be done via an array, like $$\\texttt{seen}[v]=\\texttt{true}$$ where each vertex is an integer. Alternatively, you could add the seen vertex into a HashSet or something.  \n",

      "'''Art''' is a creative activity by people. These people are called [[artist]]s. They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Artists express themselves by their art. Some people find art relaxing. Many people disagree on how to define art. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]].\n",

      "== What &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; means ==Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the [[mind|human mind]], [[spirit]] and [[soul]]. An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it. Some people also get inspired.\n",
      "The first and broadest sense of &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;arrangement&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;to arrange.&amp;quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.\n",
      "Art may express [[emotion]]. Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an [[audience]]. However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.\n",
      "== History of art ==\n",
      "There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the [[Upper Palaeolithic|Upper Paleolithic]] era.\n",
      "All of the great ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient India|India]], [[Ancient China|China]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Persia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.\n",
      "[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronze, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.\n",
      "In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a &amp;quot;[[Renaissance]]&amp;quot; which means &amp;quot;rebirth&amp;quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.\n",
      "In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].\n",
      "== Roles of art ==\n",
      "In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it. They think that the artist put his or her &amp;quot;[[talent]]&amp;quot; and industry into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist, protected by [[copyright]].\n",

      " Question: Hi! I'm looking at Section 5 for the next milestone, and it looks like we're going to be implementing a double-weighted directed graph to run Dijkstra's on. As of now, the graph implementation that I made for milestone 1 doesn't really support that kind of graph - only the directed graph that you told us to implement. Should I worry now about changing my graph implementation from milestone 1 to support edge weights, or is that something we will take care of a bit further down the road? (And for now, just worry about making a new class that implements the weighted digraph interface?) Thanks! \n",

Then, create the sets out of the $$V$$ vertices, $$O(V)$$ time. Now, you'd have to potentially call find/union on every edge, and this takes $$\\lg^*V$$ time for each edge so $$O(E \\lg^* V)$$. Asymptotically, this will just be $$O(E \\lg E) = O(E \\lg V)$$. \n",

      "If you're given weights in sorted order already, then you can do better. You can do, as you said, $$O(E \\lg^* V)$$ since you have $$O(E)$$ calls to union/find operations on $$V$$ items. \n",

      " Answer: If you imagine the SCC graph, do you agree that during the second round of DFS's, you want run DFS on a node in an SCC with out-degree 0? That way, you explore only the given connected component, and you don't \"wander\" into another SCC.

However, there is a way to find a node that is guaranteed to be in an SCC with indegree 0. Recall the lemma proven in class (and in CLRS): If $$C,C'$$ are SCC's, and if there is an edge $$C\\rightarrow C'$$ in $$G^{SCC}$$, then $$f(C)&gt;f(C')$$. This tells you that if you find the vertex with the highest finishing time during the first DFS, it must be in an SCC with indegree 0. \n",

Now, from this, you should be able to imagine what a huffman tree with height $$n-2$$ looks like: it is basically one long branch, but with the modification that the end of the branch should have 4 leaves instead of 2 (you need to shrink the height by 1).

Is it because those forward edges are back edges in $G^T$$ (taking a Kosaraju's algorithm approach)? \n",
      " Shortened Question: wondering solution practice 4  proof shows removing forward edges dfs      still   u        path   u            however  removing edges  still       u    forward edges back edges  gt    taking kosaraju s approach   \n",
      " Answer: Suppose $$(u,v)$$ is a forward edge. We know since the original graph is strongly connected, there is a $$u-v$$ path and a $$v-u$$ path. Since $$(u,v)$$ is a forward edge, that means $$v$$ is a descendant of $$u$$, so there is in fact another path from $$u$$ to $$v$$ in $$T$$ that doesn't use the edge $$(u,v)$$. Hence you can remove this edge and still have a $$u-v$$ path. Note that through all of this, the $$v-u$$ path remains untouched: removal of $$(u,v)$$ can't ruin this path. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you may wonder \"what if removing $$(u,v)$$ ruins some path between other vertices and thus ruins strongly connectedness?\" The answer to this is to realize that any path that contained the edge $$(u,v)$$ can be \"re-routed\" to go through the other $$u-v$$ path in $$T$$. \n",

      " Answer: Yes, it's pretty much impossible to eliminate all dependencies. Even our test cases for particular methods rely on other methods you've implemented (as you've probably seen). For you, ideally, all testing would involve directly manipulating package-private state, executing a single method, and then checking that the private state is correct (this is how it's taught in CIS 350). It is super tedious to do this, so at some point you need to make a call on how particular you want to be in avoiding dependencies and trusting that test-enabling methods like get or contains are correct. Even if you want to be super careful, you're still trusting that your test files are written correctly, so at some point you just have to code correctly. \n",

If you wanted to use an actual tree, you'd have the problem you said: finding the last element would be expensive.

Now, given that the first probe was not empty, the second probe is non empty with probabilty $$(n-1)/(m-1)$$. Similarly, the probability that the third probe is non-empty given the first two probes were non-empty is $$(n-2)/(m-2)$$. \n",

This is called \"first step analysis\". If the first probe is to an empty slot, we stop the search. There are 0 more probes. Otherwise, with probability $$n/m$$, we need to repeat the process, which takes $$T(m-1,n-1)$$ probes by the above argument. Hence the expected number of probes is \n",

For example, if you search \"the Corvette\", the word \"the\" shows up in a bunch of documents, but the word \"Corvette\" will probably only show up in specialized documents. You obviously want your search results to be based on the presence of the word \"Corvette\" rather than the word \"the\". IDF solves this problem: \"the\" has a really low IDF, but \"Corvette\" presumably has a high IDF value (it shows up in fewer documents). Thus the score of a document is influenced much more by the word \"Corvette\" than by \"the\".  \n",
