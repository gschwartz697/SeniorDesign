"Hi!

I'm working on task 6, trying to do the color sliders. My first instinct to accomplish this task was to have the sliders affect the color (i.e paint.color.r &lt;- __), however I would have to make the type mutable in gctx, which wouldn't work b/c the gctx is supposed to be immutable.

My next idea is to make the widget have a value controller that holds a number from 0-255 depending on the location of the mouse. Then I would create a mutable type in paint.ml that was of the same form as the type of color and could update. Then, ideally, I could apply that mutable color type to paint.color and all would be well and good. However, I have a few concerns I would like to run past someone before I change a bunch of my code:

1- Am I right in assuming I can't make the color type mutable? When I tried to change it it said that it was incompatible with the cmi but I don't know what that is.

2- Will it be an issue if I use a record within paint.ml and try to apply to to paint.color? I'm not sure it will work, since one is mutable and the other is not and because the type is only defined within Gctx so I don't think it will even be applicable. 

3- Is it necessary to create an entirely new mutable state in paint that co-exists with color? It does not seem efficient, but I am not sure where else to look for color mutability.

Basically all I've played around with so far has lead to errors but I can't make office hours. I think my main confusion rests in what is allowed to be mutable. I want to make sure that I am understanding this conceptually before I change a bunch of code.

Thank you :) ",For my slider function I had it input a gctx so that I could make the slider any color. How do you access the color of this inputted gctx because g.color (g is the name of the gctx) is coming up with an error?
"My color slider works when I added just a red color slider. But when I add green and blue sliders they don't work, and the red one just makes the color shades of white/grey/black. Is there any place that would be causing this, I haven't been able to find the bug?","My color slider seems to interfere with the way the color black is defined. Sliding it changes everything in black, but the other pre-defined colors are fine. What could be contributing to this error? "
"I am stuck on the last two pieces of color slider. My slider bars are all black. When drawing those filled rectangles, how to do I change only the color value passed into the gctx with g? Also, how do I change the text size for a draw_string?","Hello!

In implementing my color slider, I wanted it such that my red value for the color is 255 * a fraction representing where I am in the slider in relation to the entire slider bar. 

However, the fraction often comes out as a decimal value, but rgb values can't be decimals.

How do you cast on Ocaml and are we allowed to?

Thank You :D "
"For slider, how do we update just either the r, g, or b value of color? It's my understanding they aren't mutable per say but color is?",If we store a redundant state for r g b in our paint.ml implementation of color slider will we get points off even if it works properly?
"Currently, I'm calculating the center/radii from two positions (p and p1) with the ""fst"" and ""snd"" OCaml functions. I'm also using EllipseStartMode and EllipseEndMode

However, every time I enter paint and select the ellipse option and try to draw, everything (including all the buttons) disappears and I'm left with a blank canvas.

Hello! I've been struggling with the checkbox and had some questions. I chose the method of making a separate widget for the box and adding a notifier to the hpaired box + label so that wherever you click within the widget, it registers the event and changes the value in the boolean controller. I chose to implement the actual crossing by adding a change_listener to the boolean controller. 

The feedback I got from a TA was, however, that ""You may also want to consider the differences between change_listeners and event_listeners.  Neither is better or worse, but it may simplify your code to choose one approach to registering events."" I do see a way I can just use event_listeners, but I don't see how I can approach the entire problem using just change_listeners as I don't see a way to register a click for the entire widget other than event_listeners. Could I get some help with that?

Also, I was wondering about how to implement the change_listener. I want to change the box but don't see a way I can access the graphics context for the box. Let me know if there is anything you guys can help with. Thank you :) ","I have the following code for checkbox in widget:

Hello!

I implemented my checkbox, and it passed all the tests/lightbulb so now I'm on the part of making it toggle. My first question is: I noticed that for buttons, lables, notifiers, etc. we don't actually pass in a g value both in paint and widget. In what part of the program do we pass in the g and actually draw the thing? I was confused because for instance, when we do hpair, how does it know the initial graphics context to be in?

And my second question is: would there be a more efficient way to do the toggle? Or in fact, I don't even think what I am doing now is correct as I don't think I am constantly checking the value of the boolean controller. Or am I because the event loop is running?

","I really cannot figure out what is wrong with my checkbox function. It does not pass the tests with odd clicks, or the listener test. I'm not sure which parts of it are wrong and whether I'm making a logic mistake. 

let checkbox (init: bool) (s: string)
  : widget * bool value_controller =
  let s_size = Gctx.text_size s in 
  let box_size = (snd s_size, snd s_size) in
  let bvc = make_control init in
  let state : bool ref = ref init in
  let square = 
  { repaint = (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) -&gt; if init = true then Gctx.fill_rect g (0,0)
    box_size else Gctx.draw_rect g (0,0) box_size);
    handle = (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) (e: Gctx.event) -&gt; if event_within g e 
    box_size then state := not(!state)); 
    size = (fun _ -&gt; box_size)
  } 
  in
  let label : widget =
  { repaint = (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) -&gt; Gctx.draw_string g (0,0) s);
    handle = (fun _ _ -&gt; ());
    size = (fun _ -&gt; s_size)
  }
  in 
  (hpair square label, bvc)
