Thanks!\\n\\nDescription of game: This is a picture-slider game comprised of a 3X3 grid.The objective of the game is to move the puzzle pieces into the empty space to unscramble the puzzle. This is done by using the arrow keys. The game tracks how many moves you have made and displays it at the top. When you complete the puzzle, you will be asked for your name but only the top 3 names and scores will be displayed when the \"High Scores\" button is pressed. The highest score is the user who takes the least amount of moves to complete the puzzle. You can restart the puzzle at any time by hitting the \"Reshuffle\" button. Additionally, an \"Easy Reshuffle\" button has been added for testing purposes. Clicking the \"Instructions\" button will show a window with instructions for the game. There is also an undo function\\n\\n\\nDesign Concept 1: The first design concept I used is 2D arrays. I used 2D arrays to store the file names and images as well as in the fillFiles method and the fillImages method. 2D arrays were used because they were logically connected to the end state of the board, when the puzzle has been solved. My program works by filling a 2D array called files with strings that represent the file name. This is done in \"solution\" order, or the order that the pictures are supposed to be in when the game is solved. Once the 2D array of file name is created it is used to create a 2D array of images. This is also done with a nested for loop that stores the images in \"solution\" order. The 2D array of images is then used to create a linked list of puzzle pieces (which are defined with an image and position) that will be keep track of the current state of the board.\\n\\nDesign Concept 2: The second design concept I used was Collections. I used a linked list of puzzle pieces to represent the current state of the board and and the final solution. I also used a linked list of strings to represent the names of the winning players and their respective scores. The list of puzzle pieces used to represent the state of the board is shuffled at the beginning of the game and changes with each move the player makes. After each move the \"solution\" linked list is compared with this linked list, and if they are equal, the player has won. After the player has won, their name and respective move count is added to two separate text documents, \"Names.txt\" and \"Scores.txt.\" The names and scores from these text documents are then read into respective linked lists of strings and can be sorted and manipulated from there. Collections are also used to implement the \"undo\" function. All of the game states, which are originally stored as a linked list, are stored in a linked list of linked lists. When the user wants to go back, the current state is set back to the previous list that was stored\\n\\nDesign Concept 3: The third design concept I used was File I/O. I used this to implement the high score function of my game. I had three separate files, \"Names.txt\" \"Scores.txt\", and \"highScores.txt.\" Names.txt held the individual names of the winners, and scores held the respective move count of the user. Thus, the order of scores and names were related, the user in the first line of the names file had the moves count in the first line of the scores file. The names in the names file were read into a linked list of names using a Scanner. Similarly, the scores in the scores file were read into a linked list of integers. After this was done, the list of scores was sorted by a bubble sort method, and the names list followed the same changes the score list underwent. Lastly, the sorted files were read into the \"highScores\" text file in a certain format. When the high score button was pressed, only the top 3 scores are displayed.\\n\\n\\nDesign Concept 4: The fourth design concept I used was J-Unit testing. I uesd J-Unit tests to test the basic functions in by \"GameBoard\" file. tests were made to ensure the the 2D array of files was being filled correctly. Additionally, methods such as reposition, easy shuffle, fill names, fill score, and sort names and scores were tested.', 'Sorry, I\\'m a little confused. If I used linked lists for the undo function to count as collections, am I not also allowed to use lists to help with the I/O?

Pac-man works with a grid system so it seems only intuitive that I use a 2D array to help with my modelling.

The JPanel will have access to my 2D array, so I will then loop through every element of the 2D array and will decide what to populate the next \"section\" of the JPanel grid with based on the int in the corresponding element of the 2D array. This distinction between the 2D array and the JPanel grid allows for the introduction of multiple levels if I so choose to implement that.\\n\\n3) Here\\'s where I get stuck: it seems intuitive to represent the walls and floor of the game board using ints in a 2D array, but I am unsure how to represent the location of my living objects (Pac-man and the ghosts). I am debating between a) representing, say, Pac-man as another int value in the 2D array, and b) having Pac-man be his own sub-type of the GameObj class.\\n\\nOption b) seems more reasonable, but I am unsure how to represent the location of Pac-man if I were to implement him as an object. I can\\'t simply rely on traditional x-y coordinates because Pac-man and the ghosts move in a quantized fashion. However, option a) seems unreasonable because it is easier to listen for arrow-key inputs and change Pac-man\\'s position if he were an object instead of simply an int-value in a 2D array.\\n\\nMay I be offered any suggestions?
