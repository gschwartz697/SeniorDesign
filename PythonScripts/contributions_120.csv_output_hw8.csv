Quick summary:
""file"" is a TreeMap &lt;String, TreeSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;( );
String is the misspelled word
TreeSet&lt;String&gt; is a set of correct words that can ""replace"" the misspelled word.

Question:
1. Currently, I don't think the statement condition (b.read( ) != -1) in my while statement is good enough. Is there anything that I could improve on/consider in this conditional?
2. When I read in the line using a buffered reader ""b,"" I take in the whole line, take in the index and substring the line according to what comes before the comma and what comes after the comma. Is this good enough, or are there other things I should consider?
3. I'm worried my choice in data structure is too complicated... should I be looking to implement something simpler? I'm scared of moving forward in the homework b/c in HW07 I did really badly because I pushed forward with a double TreeMap and it was super hard :-(
4. When I try to ""put"" the correct word into the TreeSet as the ""value"" of the &lt;k, v&gt; TreeMap ""file,"" should I make the TreeSet into a private field at the top of my code, or should I instantiate the TreeSet in my while loop? This is already feeling too complicated... :'(
5. ""words.add"" returns a boolean but I need it to return a TreeSet... I am also stuck on this as well.

Warmly,
Anders.

Do I need to account for any possible IOExceptions in next() in TokenScanner or can I assume these will only happen in the constructor?,"If we have an auto-generated catch block that catches IOException e and the only thing it does is e.printStackTrace(), can we leave it as it is or do we have to handle exceptions another way?"
"I wrote the following test for my TokenScanner next() method.

@Test //test getNextWord edge cases
    public void testGetNextTokenWordSingleNonWord() throws IOException {
        Reader in = new StringReader("" ""); 
        TokenScanner d = new TokenScanner(in);
        try {

        } finally {
            in.close();
        }
    }
Basically I just want to test if it returns a space.

But what actually happens is my next method gets caught in a while loop reading a question mark ""?"".
However, within my while loop if I put a break statement to prevent the loop, it correctly returns the space character. What might be causing this? The relevant portion of my next method is below.

//return non word characters
    	else //if currentLetter is not the start of the word
    	{
    		//add it to the String and return it
    		while (!isWordCharacter(currentLetter))

    			//break;

1) Should I be reading the whole file at the start to determine if the file contains at least one line of invalid format? Or read it incrementally and only throw a formatException when we get to an invalid line? 

2) I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to code whether or not a stored line from BufferReader contains invalid format. I'm trying to use the split method on the String (see code below) but am confused as to how it works (I've read the Javadoc but it contains a lot of language that we haven't learned yet).

I don't know how I can proceed without falling prey to IndexOutOfBoundExceptions, since the line of code can contain so many different combinations of words/non-words/commas/non-commas. What's perhaps a simpler way for me to go about addressing the invalid cases of:

"When my TokenScanner is a string of ""Aren't you /ntired"", my function is recognizing ""Aren't"" as the first word token and returning it in the first call to d.next(). However, because I'm calling rd.read() in my while-loop and again at the beginning of my try-block, I think it's skipping over the whitespace after the ""Aren't"". What should be happening is that when it hits the whitespace, it registers it as a non-word character and funnels through to the else block of this function. 

However, I need to first set a to rd.read() in order to let my function recognize the input. Here, when I call it for the first time, I set ""a"" to ""A"" (for ""Aren't) and that's what gets my function off the ground. Further, I need to increment the ""a"" variable within my while loop so I traverse through the string and print out different things instead of just staying in one place. I'm not sure how to reconcile these. Any suggestions? I've been trying to print to debug and different things, and I just can't seem to get over this hump.

The dictionary file contains a blank line in the middle. (Remember: You can always make new .txt files to help write test cases.)
Are we just checking to see if a word in the dictionary still exists despite there being a space break in the text file?

For this test: 
The dictionary file has words with whitespace around them, and you check if one of those words is in the dictionary.

    public SwapCorrector(Dictionary dict) {
     this.word = word;","For checkDocument I've seen other posts saying that the Scanner class should be used to get the user input.

1) How do we use the Scanner class to do that? Do we do sc.next()? Should this be returning an int?

2) Once we've used our Corrector to output a set of corrections for the wrong word, how do we present those words (alphabetically) to the user? There are literally no instructions for how to do this.

I assume that once we present the correction to the user we just use the user input to determine which of those corrections to write out. But if the user chooses the ""different"" option and inputs their own word, do we have to handle that ourselves as well?"
