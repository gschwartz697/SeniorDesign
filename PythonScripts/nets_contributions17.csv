<p></p>
<p>I&#39;ll add a couple of things:</p>
<p></p>
<p>For #2 - how IP addresses are allocated is a little beyond the scope of this class. Generally, what will happen is, a big organization can say I want 10k IP addresses and IANA will assign a block from what&#39;s available. You can read more about it here - <a href=""https://www.iana.org/numbers"">https://www.iana.org/numbers</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>For #3 - For port numbers, IANA maintains a list of &#34;well-known&#34; port numbers. 0-1023 are reserved for &#34;common&#34; applications like email, FTP, etc. So in our testing, it&#39;s fine to use something temporary. If it&#39;s going to used by a lot of people, to &#34;play nice&#34;, we should request a reserved number from IANA.

Or are we looking specifically for the role King, and thus this element should be excluded? Also, should our lookups be case-sensitive (that is, King and king are 2 different searches)?

<p>1.1  It is true. Let us look at the dominant strategy solution for each case. For player 1, if Player 2 does not hire a lawyer, it is in Player 1’s best interest to also not hire a lawyer. If Player 2 hires a lawyer, it is in Player 1’s best interest to not hire a lawyer.</p>

<p>Now, let us examine this from Player 2’s side. If Player 1 hires a lawyer, it is again in Player 2’s best interest not to hire one (35 &gt; 30). If Player 1 does not hire a lawyer, it is again in Player 2’s best interest not to hire one.</p>

<p>Hi folks,<br /><br />Thursday, April 27th from noon-2pm will host the latest installment of the CIS Project Demo Day, where students from a variety of project-based courses will have a chance to demo their final projects. We&#39;re taking over two floors of the Towne building (2nd and 3rd).<br /><br />We expect to have projects from a variety of the CIS 19x minicourses (including Python, Rails, iOS, Android, Javascript, and others).<br /><br />We&#39;ll have some CIS alums from Google and Comcast coming to act as judges. The best projects will receive a prize: a $25 Computer Connection gift card for each project member.<br /><br />Also, lunch will be provided :-). So please stop by if you can to check out the cool work going on in these classes!<br /><br />- Swapneel Sheth and Joe Devietti, organizers</p>","Hey all.

We'll have another CIS Demo Day on Thursday. Here are more details and the email that will get sent out to a few mailing lists.

Please consider participating and/or attending.

<p>For HW5, my group is analyzing Amazon data (~500,000 products). I implemented Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm to calculate the average shortest path length between all pairs of products. I was going to compare that value with the average shortest path length between all products and the product with the best sales rank. However, my runtime is horrible and I can&#39;t figure out how to improve it. I&#39;ve tested the code on small inputs (~30 products) and it works, but it&#39;s been running for 12.5hrs and it&#39;s only calculated ~5,000 shortest paths. Do you have any advice?

Noor Salman, the wife of the killer who opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last summer, will be able to leave jail within days ahead of her trial on charges of helping carry out the massacre, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled Wednesday.
MURDER SUSPECT ALEX DEATON CAUGHT AFTER MULTI-STATE MANHUNT
In announcing her decision, U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu said Salman, 31, was not a danger to the public and had no credible connections to the Islamic State terror group -- which the prosecution strongly disputed. Salman will have to remain in jail for at least two days, giving the feds time to appeal.
Her husband, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to several terror groups during the shooting that killed 49 people in June of last year before police killed him. After the attack, Salman moved from Orlando to her mother&#39;s home in Rodeo, outside San Francisco, where she was arrested in January.
FACE-BITING SUSPECT&#39;S APOLOGY IS &#39;ELABORATE LIE,&#39; VICTIM&#39;S SON SAYS
Salman drove her husband to the nightclub at least once before the attack, a law enforcement source told Fox News. It also emerged that she shopped with Mateen at a Walmart the night before the attack, when he stocked up on ammo.

In addition, the couple texted each other during the massacre, investigators said. Mateen reportedly asked his wife, &#34;Do you see what&#39;s happening?&#34; She was said to have replied, &#34;No?&#34;, as Mateen responded, &#34;I love you, babe.&#34;
Salman failed four lie detector tests before she faced charges, a source close to the invesigation added.
The judge said Salman would have to wear an electronic ankle monitor while she lives with her uncle in Northern California.
&#34;She wants to be home,&#34; defense attorney Linda Moreno told reporters outside court on Wednesday. &#34;She wants to see her son,&#34; attorney Charles Swift added.
Salman&#39;s mother and uncle put up their houses to guarantee that Salman would not escape. Ryu called the conditions of Salman&#39;s release &#34;essentially house arrest,&#34; because she can leave only for court appearances, meetings with her local attorneys and doctor&#39;s appointments.
Salman has pleaded not guilty to charges of aiding and abetting Mateen and lying to investigators after the shooting. A trial has not been scheduled.
Salman initially said she didn&#39;t know anything about the attack but later told investigators Mateen abused steroids, was &#34;pumped up&#34; on the night of the attack and said &#34;this is the one day&#34; as he walked out the door, federal prosecutor Sara Sweeney has said in court.
Sweeney also said the couple ran up $25,000 in credit card debt and spent $5,000 in cash in the days before the shooting. Among the purchases was an $8,000 diamond ring for Salman. In addition, they made Salman the death beneficiary of his bank account, prosecutors said.
Swift said outside court earlier this month that Salman made those statements without a lawyer present during an 18-hour interrogation immediately after the attack.

A federal judge in California declined Wednesday to release the wife of the man who killed dozens of people at a Florida nightclub and ordered a psychiatric evaluation after prosecutors said she accompanied her husband on scouting trips for potential targets.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu in Oakland said she wanted a psychiatric evaluation done of Noor Salman, 31, before deciding whether to release her from jail pending a trial on charges of supporting her husband&#39;s attack and then lying to investigators about it. Salmon has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Salman was arrested by federal authorities last month at her mother&#39;s home in suburban San Francisco, where she moved with her 4-year-old son after her husband Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Mateen pledged allegiance to several terror organizations, including ISIS, during the attack before police shot and killed him.
Federal prosecutor Sara Sweeney divulged some details of the allegations for the first time in court Wednesday while arguing against the release of Salman. Sweeney said Mateen asked Salman about &#34;what would make more people upset an attack at downtown Disney, or at a club?&#34;
In addition to accompanying her husband on scouting trips, Salman watched him leave their apartment with a gun and a backpack full of ammunition on the night of the shooting, Sweeney said.
Authorities say Salman initially said she didn&#39;t know anything about the attack but later told investigators Mateen abused steroids, was &#34;pumped up&#34; on the night of the attack, and said &#34;this is the one day&#34; as he walked out the door, Sweeney said in court. &#34;I knew when he left he was going to commit the attack,&#34; Sweeney said Salman told investigators.
Sweeney also told the court the couple ran up $25,000 in credit card debt and spent $5,000 in cash in the days before the shooting. Among the purchases was an $8,000 diamond ring for Salman. In addition, Mateen and Salman made her the death beneficiary of his bank account.
Salman&#39;s attorney, Charles Swift, told reporters outside the court that Salman made those statements without a lawyer present during an 18-hour interrogation immediately after the attack, and that he hasn&#39;t yet received a transcript or recording of the interrogation to determine the context of her statements and accuracy of the allegations.
Swift argued that prosecutors were charging Salman with the crimes of her husband. Mateen physically abused Salman, according to Swift, and never told her about his plans to carry out the killings. Her defense team told the court she was a special education student and couldn&#39;t concort a plan.
Swift pointed out that Mateen was a security guard and left the couple&#39;s home hundreds of times with a gun and ammunition. In addition, the defense claimed Mateen watched ISIS videos with his son, and was &#34;bulked up&#34; due to being on steroids at the time of the shooting.
It was the first time Salman&#39;s legal team heard details of the allegations. &#34;We frankly expected more,&#34; attorney Linda Moreno said outside court.
Salman&#39;s mother and uncle have pledged to put up their homes as collateral to secure her release from jail pending trial. Federal prosecutors are seeking to transfer Salman to Florida to face the charges that could bring a sentence of life in prison.

<p>How can I get non-NaN cosine similarity values? I didn&#39;t have this issue in HW 4. </p>","Hi, I am reusing the document search code and altering it so that instead of having files for documents, I write new files for the URLs I get on the internet. 

This is my code. I have an array list of strings containing the URLs, and in the for-loop, I created a new file for each URL and filled the file with the text in the article. 

public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		
		ArrayList&lt;Page&gt; documents = new ArrayList&lt;Page&gt;();
		Page query = new Page(""query.txt"");
		documents.add(query);

		//instantiate Main class
		Main object = new Main();
		
		//obtain set of URLs (String)
		ArrayList&lt;String&gt; urls = object.getURLs();
		
		//print URLs
		System.out.println(urls);
		
		int count = 1;
		
		for(int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++){
			String url = urls.get(i);
			try {
				//create a file
				
				writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(""file_"" + count + "".txt""), ""utf-8""));
			    Document doc = Jsoup.connect(url).get();
			    System.out.println(""Writing 'file_'"" + count + "".txt"");
			    
			    //write to file
			    writer.write(doc.select(""p"").text());
			    Elements paragraphs = doc.select(""p"");
			    System.out.println(""file_"" + count+ "".txt: "" + url);
			    for(Element p : paragraphs) {
			    	String text = p.text();
			    	
			    	//remove copyright symbols that might mess with cosine similarity values
			    	if(!text.startsWith(""This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes."")) {
			    		System.out.println(p.text());
			    	}
			    }
			    
			    //create a page object out of the file
			    Page page = new Page(""file_"" + count + "".txt"");
			    documents.add(page);
			    
			    //increment file number count
			    count++;
			    
			    System.out.println();
				
			} catch (IOException ex) {
				
			} finally {
			    writer.close();
			}
		}

I then printed out what was in each file to confirm that I added the correct text from the article. This is what it printed this in the console.

Noor Salman, the wife of the killer who opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last summer, will be able to leave jail within days ahead of her trial on charges of helping carry out the massacre, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled Wednesday.
MURDER SUSPECT ALEX DEATON CAUGHT AFTER MULTI-STATE MANHUNT
In announcing her decision, U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu said Salman, 31, was not a danger to the public and had no credible connections to the Islamic State terror group -- which the prosecution strongly disputed. Salman will have to remain in jail for at least two days, giving the feds time to appeal.
Her husband, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to several terror groups during the shooting that killed 49 people in June of last year before police killed him. After the attack, Salman moved from Orlando to her mother's home in Rodeo, outside San Francisco, where she was arrested in January.
FACE-BITING SUSPECT'S APOLOGY IS 'ELABORATE LIE,' VICTIM'S SON SAYS
Salman drove her husband to the nightclub at least once before the attack, a law enforcement source told Fox News. It also emerged that she shopped with Mateen at a Walmart the night before the attack, when he stocked up on ammo.

In addition, the couple texted each other during the massacre, investigators said. Mateen reportedly asked his wife, ""Do you see what's happening?"" She was said to have replied, ""No?"", as Mateen responded, ""I love you, babe.""
Salman failed four lie detector tests before she faced charges, a source close to the invesigation added.
The judge said Salman would have to wear an electronic ankle monitor while she lives with her uncle in Northern California.
""She wants to be home,"" defense attorney Linda Moreno told reporters outside court on Wednesday. ""She wants to see her son,"" attorney Charles Swift added.
Salman's mother and uncle put up their houses to guarantee that Salman would not escape. Ryu called the conditions of Salman's release ""essentially house arrest,"" because she can leave only for court appearances, meetings with her local attorneys and doctor's appointments.
Salman has pleaded not guilty to charges of aiding and abetting Mateen and lying to investigators after the shooting. A trial has not been scheduled.
Salman initially said she didn't know anything about the attack but later told investigators Mateen abused steroids, was ""pumped up"" on the night of the attack and said ""this is the one day"" as he walked out the door, federal prosecutor Sara Sweeney has said in court.
Sweeney also said the couple ran up $25,000 in credit card debt and spent $5,000 in cash in the days before the shooting. Among the purchases was an $8,000 diamond ring for Salman. In addition, they made Salman the death beneficiary of his bank account, prosecutors said.
Swift said outside court earlier this month that Salman made those statements without a lawyer present during an 18-hour interrogation immediately after the attack.

A federal judge in California declined Wednesday to release the wife of the man who killed dozens of people at a Florida nightclub and ordered a psychiatric evaluation after prosecutors said she accompanied her husband on scouting trips for potential targets.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu in Oakland said she wanted a psychiatric evaluation done of Noor Salman, 31, before deciding whether to release her from jail pending a trial on charges of supporting her husband's attack and then lying to investigators about it. Salmon has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Salman was arrested by federal authorities last month at her mother's home in suburban San Francisco, where she moved with her 4-year-old son after her husband Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Mateen pledged allegiance to several terror organizations, including ISIS, during the attack before police shot and killed him.
Federal prosecutor Sara Sweeney divulged some details of the allegations for the first time in court Wednesday while arguing against the release of Salman. Sweeney said Mateen asked Salman about ""what would make more people upset an attack at downtown Disney, or at a club?""
In addition to accompanying her husband on scouting trips, Salman watched him leave their apartment with a gun and a backpack full of ammunition on the night of the shooting, Sweeney said.
Authorities say Salman initially said she didn't know anything about the attack but later told investigators Mateen abused steroids, was ""pumped up"" on the night of the attack, and said ""this is the one day"" as he walked out the door, Sweeney said in court. ""I knew when he left he was going to commit the attack,"" Sweeney said Salman told investigators.
Sweeney also told the court the couple ran up $25,000 in credit card debt and spent $5,000 in cash in the days before the shooting. Among the purchases was an $8,000 diamond ring for Salman. In addition, Mateen and Salman made her the death beneficiary of his bank account.
Salman's attorney, Charles Swift, told reporters outside the court that Salman made those statements without a lawyer present during an 18-hour interrogation immediately after the attack, and that he hasn't yet received a transcript or recording of the interrogation to determine the context of her statements and accuracy of the allegations.
Swift argued that prosecutors were charging Salman with the crimes of her husband. Mateen physically abused Salman, according to Swift, and never told her about his plans to carry out the killings. Her defense team told the court she was a special education student and couldn't concort a plan.
Swift pointed out that Mateen was a security guard and left the couple's home hundreds of times with a gun and ammunition. In addition, the defense claimed Mateen watched ISIS videos with his son, and was ""bulked up"" due to being on steroids at the time of the shooting.
It was the first time Salman's legal team heard details of the allegations. ""We frankly expected more,"" attorney Linda Moreno said outside court.

stud,524,exam,2017-05-07 04:35:28 UTC,"<p>Yes, the players are the voters. Based on my notes from class, the payoffs are more abstract, but they just represent how badly a player wants a given outcome. So for example, player 1&#39;s preference is A &gt; N &gt; B - they want A the most with payoff 2, then N with payoff 1, and they want outcome B the least, so the payoff is 0. Round 1 is A vs. B, followed by the winner of round 1 vs. N.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We represented a player&#39;s strategy as 3 letters, where the first letter is their vote for round 1, the second letter is their vote for round 2 if round 2 is A vs. N, and the third letter is their vote for round 2 if round 2 is B vs. N. This would produce an 8 x 8 x 8 matrix, but we just looked at the 8 strategies for Player 1 and narrowed it down to 2 weakly dominating strategies (AAN and BAN). We could have done this for all 3 players but to save time we were just given the 2 strategies for each player.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, we made two 2x2 tables, where one side was player 1&#39;s two strategies and one side was player 2&#39;s two strategies. The first table payoffs were based off of player 3&#39;s first strategy, and the second table was based off of player 3&#39;s second strategy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To calculate the payoffs for each cell of each table, we had to actually &#34;run&#34; the votes. For example, the first cell was Player 1: AAN, Player 2: AAB, Player 3: ANN. Round 1 uses the first letter, and A wins unanimously since all players voted A. Then since A won, round 2 will be A vs. N. Each player&#39;s vote is the second letter, so the players vote A, A, N respectively, and A wins by majority, so A is the overall result. Then we can fill in the payoff for each player based on their original preferences. Player 1 had a payoff of 2 for A, and player 2 and 3 had a payoff of 1 for A. So the payoff for that cell is 2, 1, 1.</p>

<p>An ascending bid auction is effectively second price since the price keeps going up till someone is willing to bid.

Question 9.8-2

We will ask how the number of bidders in a second-price, sealed-bid auction affects how much the seller can expect to receive for his object. Assume that there are two bidders who have independent, private values v, which are either 1 or 3. For each bidder, the probabilities of 1 and 3 are both ½. If there is a tie at a bid of x for the highest bid, the winner is selected at random from among the highest bidders and the price is x.

A) Show that the seller's expected revenue is 6/4.

There are 4 possible outcomes in this situation, each with 1/4 probability of occurring.

The expected revenue of the seller is then 6/4:

E(R) = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 3/4 = 6/4

B) Now let’s suppose there are three bidders who have independent, private values , which are either 1 or 3. For each bidder, the probabilities of 1 and 3 are both ½. What is the seller’s expected revenue in this case?

There are 8 possible outcomes in this situation, each with 1/8 probability of occurring.

Question 9.8-2

We will ask how the number of bidders in a second-price, sealed-bid auction affects how much the seller can expect to receive for his object. Assume that there are two bidders who have independent, private values v, which are either 1 or 3. For each bidder, the probabilities of 1 and 3 are both ½. If there is a tie at a bid of x for the highest bid, the winner is selected at random from among the highest bidders and the price is x.

A) Show that the seller's expected revenue is 6/4.

There are 4 possible outcomes in this situation, each with 1/4 probability of occurring.

The expected revenue of the seller is then 6/4:

E(R) = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 3/4 = 6/4

B) Now let’s suppose there are three bidders who have independent, private values , which are either 1 or 3. For each bidder, the probabilities of 1 and 3 are both ½. What is the seller’s expected revenue in this case?

There are 8 possible outcomes in this situation, each with 1/8 probability of occurring.

The expected revenue of the seller is then 2:
E(R) = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 = 2

C) Briefly explain why changing the number of bidders affect’s the seller’s expected revenue.

The dominant strategy in a second-price, sealed-bid auction is to bid your true value. Because the seller receives the value of the second-highest bid, increasing the number of bidders increases the likelihood of ties between the highest-value bid. Thus, rather than getting the second-highest bid, we can see that the seller will receive the tied first-highest bid instead.

<p>&#34;However, we can’t simply fix up the translation by eliminating weakly dominated strategies. We saw earlier that iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies can be done in any order: all orders yield the same final result. But this is not true for the iterated deletion of weakly dominated strategies. To see this, suppose we vary the Market Entry Game slightly so that the payoff from the joint strategy (E, C) is (0, 0). (In this version, both firms know they will fail to gain a positive payoff even if Firm 2 cooperates on entry, although they still don’t do as badly as when Firm 2 retaliates.) R is a weakly dominated strategy as before, GAMES but now so is E. (E and S produce the same payoff for Firm 1 when Firm 2 chooses C, and S produces a strictly higher payoff when Firm 2 chooses R.)<br />In this version of the game, there are now three (pure-strategy) Nash equilibria: (S, C), (E, C), and (S, R).

Alternately, if we first eliminate the weakly dominated strategy E, then we are left with (S, C) and (S, R) as equilibria. In both cases, no further elimination of weakly dominated strategies is possible, so the order of deletion affects the final set of equilibria. We can ask which of these equilibria actually make sense as predictions of play in this game.
