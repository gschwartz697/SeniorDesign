If a user disconnects, I will have to check to every single channel and ensure the user is removed from all of them.

This way all the data is stored in the main collection of users inside ServerModel.

So I have a Channel class and a user class, and as above I store the currently registered users as a treeset, a map between the userID and the nickname, and a map between the Channel name and the Channel. I am also storing the users connected to the Channel inside the Channel class as a treeset.

The complication I am running into is because I am trying to get the Channel Object (through the channel name), get the channel's users, and get the user's nickname\\xa0by getting the user's ID. Should I change my implementation at this point? More specifically, I am considering making a map of nicknames and users but it seems redundant since I already have a set of current users and an ID mapping of the nicknames.

I'm using a helper function to constantly add to a Set of strings from a set of integers (i have a map that goes from a userID (key, integer) to a nickname (value, String).

I wasn't quite sure about the ASM for this code and thought it might make a copy somewhere so just decided to be safe. Am wondering I could just make it void!

Although my code compiled (thus using up 1 of my 3 free submissions) the first error was listed as “User cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable” which leads me to believe that many of the other failures are simply because the User class I made did not implement the Comparable&lt;User&gt; interface (which I have since fixed).
