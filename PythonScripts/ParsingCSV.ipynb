      " Answer: When I look at your code, I don't see any errors popping up.  Codio might simply be having a little hiccup.  I would recommend, if you haven't already, refreshing Codio.  If that doesn't work, closing out of Codio completely and logging back in.  If you're using Safari, it might be better to work on a browser that better supports Codio, like Firefox or Chrome.  Finally, make sure your window size isn't skewed.  Sometimes if you manually resize your browser Codio glitches out.  Let me know if none of those fix your problem - if the error still appears, let me know which line down in the followup discussions and I can try to take a closer look. \n",

      " Answer: A Set (in general) has no duplicate elements and is unordered. What this means is that if I construct a set by adding 1, then 2, then 2, and then 1, I get an equivalent set to adding 2 and then 1 (to the empty set in both cases). However, when we are actually implementing a set, we can represent them in a number of different ways. One way would be to simply use a list and remove duplicates. This would make certain operations easier, like add (just look through the list and see if the element is there, and if not, add it), but it would make other operations hard to implement, like equals. In this HW, we are representing sets as sorted lists, which helps us implement certain functions.\n",

      "Basically, inside the module where you are implementing OLSet, a set is an ordered list, and this helps with implementing some functions. Outside the module, you don't know how the set is implemented, so all you know are the properties of the Set interface and the invariant that sets are unordered and have no duplicates. \n",

You can think of variables on the stack as key-value pairs, where the var name is the key and the value is either the primitive data type stored there (e.g. an integer), or the pointer to the heap (which you can visualize as the arrow itself).

In the example I gave above, q = n (structural), and q == n (referential). Furthermore, m = n (structural), but m DOES NOT == n (referential) because they are pointing to DIFFERENT Some bubbles, which are stored in the computer as different locations in the heap. For this same reason, m = q (structural), but m DOES NOT == q (referential). Remember that the Some bubble is actually shorthand for the Some \"box\" that goes on the heap that in turn has a reference to the value inside the Some. If you have two items that are pointing to different Some boxes, they are DEFINITELY NOT referentially equal. Items that are structurally equal are \"automatically\" referentially equal, but it does not necessarily go the other way.

Is it alright if my second function returns a failwith if a None option is inputted (given that I would only run it on an option after using the first helper to make sure it has Some and not None)? Is there some simpler way to isolate the contents of a Some option? Thank you!  \n",

      " Answer: That's part of it! There are 2 main differences between tail recursion and regular recursion. The first is that we can use constant stack space because we don't need to remember the previous recursive calls and where we were. The only thing we return at each step of the function is another call to loop, so Ocaml will optimize this by popping the function call off the stack, because we don't need to remember it. Therefore, we only use constant stack space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other difference is the order in which we are evaluating things. Notice that in tail recursion, by the time we get to the end of the list or queue, we have our answer, so we accumulate our answer as we go along, from head to tail. Using regular recursion, we don't start computing anything until we reach the base case, and then we end up evaluating backwards, from the tail to the head. \n",

      "Now that we know the type of y, we can also find out the type of x.  Since y is a 'a list, x must be of type 'a.  We know this because x is consed onto y, which can only happen if x is of the same type as the 'a elements in y, a 'a list.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now let's look at fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt; x::y), knowing that x : 'a, y : 'a list, and (fun y -&gt; x::y) : ('a list -&gt; 'a list).  fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt; x::y) takes in x and returns (fun y -&gt; x::y).  Therefore we know its type is 'a -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list.\n",

The moral here is that it doesn't matter if the function is anonymous, what matters is that it's the right type.\n",

So, now this becomes a problem of type inference. I.e. can we figure out the type of x and acc by looking at (in this case) 1) the definition of fold 2) the other inputs we pass fold and 3) the body of the anonymous function? Here's some examples to show how we do that:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) If I pass to fold a list of ints, then x must be an int. I know because in fold's def, the list input is a 'a list, and combine is 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b. So, an int list means all 'a values are ints.\n",
      "(2) With a function fun x -&gt; x + 1. That's valid OCaml, and x must be type int for the expression to type check because + requires to ints\n",
      "(3) If I pass fold fun x acc -&gt; x + acc again due to the definition of +, I know that x and acc both must be ints for it to type check. Now, that gives me a lot of info since combine is 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b (i.e. I could've written fun (x: 'a) (acc: 'b) : 'b = x + acc but we don't need to) and we know x is an int and acc is an int, so we know all throughout a call to fold involving this function, 'a and 'b are both int. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on, f x on the other hand would not type check because f expects as its first argument a 'a -&gt; 'a value, not a 'a value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's say we have let j (a: 'a) (b: 'a) : 'a = ... Now, j x is a valid partial application because j's type is 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a. And, j x has the type 'a -&gt; 'a.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the key with understanding function types is that every function can essentially be viewed as T1 -&gt; T2 where it takes T1 as an arg and returns T2. For f, T1 is 'a -&gt; 'a and T2 is 'a -&gt; unit. For h, T1 is 'a and T2 is 'a. For j, T1 is 'a and T2 is 'a -&gt; 'a. If you get that, you're in great shape. From that, you can also see that every function application where you pass it multiple arguments as once, e.g. add 1 2 is executed as a series of partial function applications where OCaml does add 1 2 ==&gt; aFuncThatAdds1ToItsArg 2 ==&gt; 3\n",

      " Answer: It is useful to proceed in a very careful manner with these questions. Here is the information we have so far: sum is a function that takes in 2 int arguments and transform is a function that takes in 2 arguments, one is a function and the other is a list. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now lets move from inwards out. We see that the function transform is taking in is transform sum. Note that here both transform and sum are partially applied. Consider only the inner transform for now. The function passed in is sum. Since sum takes in 2 arguments, applying sum to one integer argument would be partial application, and it would result in an int -&gt; int function. \n",
      "\n",
      "We know that the second argument to the inner transform has to be a list, and since sum is applied on it, it has to be an int list. Therefore, if transform sum is being called on an int list, and the int list is one element of the actual list, we have that the type of the actual list is int list list. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we know that transform sum transforms a list from an int list to an (int -&gt; int) list. Therefore, we know that each int list will be converted to an (int -&gt; int) list and therefore, the total list will be converted into an (int -&gt; int) list list.  \n",

      " Answer: There is no fixed curve for this class and, in particular, (unlike some other schools or courses), we don't curve down in this class. We feel that CIS 120 is challenging enough with the homework assignments and exams that having a forced curve down would be too mean and not reflect what everyone has learnt throughout the semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "(This is also by design since we want CIS to be collaborative and encourage everyone to help each other understand the material (within the bounds of the academic integrity policy), since someone else getting a higher grade doesn't lower your grade in any way.)\n",
      "\n",
      "What this means is that if you calculate your weighted average based on the percentages on the CIS 120 website, that'll be the lowest grade you can get. The curve, if there is any, will only benefit you. We also don't have a fixed median grade for this class - it's typically in the high B range, but it changes from semester to semester and it could be higher or lower depending on how everyone's grades are this Fall.\n",

      "The idea of enclosing a piece of local state such that it is only accessible to the functions that operate on that function (i.e. a closure) is to help with encapsulation/protect it from being randomly altered. It is similar in idea to having a private variable in a class in Java. With a private variable in a class, you would have to write getters/setters in order to access that variable from outside the class. But when you are inside that class, you can access the private variable however you want. Similarly, in OCaml (and your make_control), you can't access value directly, but have to set/get it using add_change_listener, get_value, and change_value.\n",

When you call one of the functions, it potentially changes that state in the heap and yup, you are just mutating the references and updating that information.\n",

      " Answer: Remember that an event_listener is just another name for a function from type Gctx.gctx -&gt; Gctx.event -&gt; unit. These functions can be used in the handle function of a widget, which has the same type. So in the handle function for your checkbox, you will have to use an event_listener, either explicitly or implicitly. However, for a checkbox, there are 2 main items to deal with: you want to change the state of the checkbox (clicked/not clicked) on a certain event (mouseclick), and you want to run whatever functions are in your list of change_listeners whenever the state of the checkbox changes. \n",

      " Answer: Whenever the canvas repaints itself, it automatically calls all of its composite widgets to repaint themselves.  For example, look at how hpair calls the repaints of its composite w1 and w2 widgets.  Therefore, you can assume the repaint function will be called automatically by the eventloop.  You do not need to call repaint in handle. \n",

I did this simply as an exercise to test myself and my understanding of the paint program.

      " Answer: All we ask is that your checkbox is sufficiently general, so you should be able specify what the text is in the on/off states. This does not appear to be the case with your current implementation, but if you were to make the text the following: \"s (ON/OFF)\", where s is the input string to the checkbox function, and ON/OFF toggles based on state, then this should be fine. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Your slider may not break any other features in your paint program or vice versa. In previous semesters, students have added a slider for line thickness for example, but this means it must work in some reasonable way with your (required) thickness checkbox. For example, the thickness level set by the slider might only be applied to shapes when the checkbox is checked. Similarly, pressing the color buttons should not hinder the performance of color sliders.\"\n",

Recall that change_listeners allow other parts of the program to listen to and react to changes in the state of a value controller (feel free to follow up if you have questions about this). Instead, you need to make the checkbox react to certain events, which will result in the state being toggled. What field of a widget deals with reacting to events? \n",

      " Answer: The state that is passed in as an argument is the initial state of the checkbox.  If true, it starts out on.  If false, it starts out off.  This argument is a boolean that you will have to store somewhere in your code. For repaint, you should be drawing the checkbox.  You can choose how to do this - you can draw four lines, use the border widget, use the label widget, directly call gctx draw functions, etc.   The size function will return the size of whatever you draw.  For example (and you do not have to adhere to this strategy), if I am drawing a 4x4 rectangle for my checkbox then I would return a size of (4, 4). I hope that helps clear things up a bit! \n",

All of the functionality of the slider should be written in widget.ml, and the only thing you should do in paint.ml is creating the sliders and adding the appropriate functions to make them change the color.

Red pixels occur 50 times, blue 25, and green 10.Your palette size is 2, which means you want to color your picture with at most 2 colors from the palette. Since red and blue occur the most, we select red and blue as our palette (size 2 palette).We then go back through the original picture and for every pixel replace it with either red or blue (colors in our palette) depending on if the color of the pixel is closest to red or blue respectively.  \n",

Tail recursive functions will never exhaust stack space no matter how much they run, because they take constant stack space (the recursive calls aren't aggregated in the end). On the other hand, non tail recursive functions would use up stack space, and could possibly exhaust it if the input is too large/if there is an infinite loop \n",

      "I'm not sure how this function works! For mk_buffered, we're \"popping off\" the first element in the list when we call produce, right? And I get that we're supposed to return the first element in the stream when we call produce.\n",

      " Answer: At a high level, the 'a buffered type is allowing us to view what the next element of the stream and still have access to it without advancing the stream. This is what the \"peek\" method of the buffered type is doing. Notice this function returns a tuple of a ’a stream and a ’a buffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "For (1), When produce is actually called, we want to advance the value stored in the buffer forward by one and update the state appropriately. We couldn't update the 'a buffered's state if we did not rewrite the produce function for the 'a stream we return. \n",
      "\n",
      "For your question (2), this does not compile. &lt;- can only be used with records. More generally, remember that buffered stores the next value in the stream. When produce is called, we want to return that \"next\" value since it has now been produced. We also want to update the buffered value to be the next one in the stream, which is why we let buf.contents &lt;- s.produce().\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure I understand your question (3). mk_buffered returns a tuple of a 'a stream and a 'a buffered. As defined, a 'a stream is a record with one field in it named produce, of type unit -&gt; 'a. A 'a buffered is a record with one field in it named peek, of type unit -&gt; 'a. In mk_buffered, we return this:\n",

As you collect coins, you can also purchase new boat colors, new perks like a gun to shoot down obstacles, stronger bullets, and things like that. Also, after every level you complete, you have the opportunity to wager a certain amount of coins in order to win a multiplier of that amount, so you can win coins or actually lose coins, but will make the likelihood greater that you win coins, but it will be implemented with a weighted randomness.\n",

      " Answer: Have you checked out the Mushroom of Doom code, specifically in GameCourt.java? You want to set up and fill your array before drawing it. This is usually not done in JFrame, but it could be, since JFrame is just the general window of your game. You probably want to put your game in its own JPanel, so the creation should be done on that JPanel. \n",

      " Answer: No, you don't necessarily need to create a whole separate class for it. MVC can also apply to more specific components or functions of your game -- for example, having a function to draw the tile is something that's very gui/view related and is done by iterating through your tileMap. However, you may have another function in the same class that updates a Tile in the tileMap which is very controller/model based and doesn't require anything related to the gui/view. I just uploaded another example into the student accessible recitation materials drive (pokemon.zip) which might be helpful.\n",

      " Question: I'm interested in implementing Pac-man for my final homework assignment but I am having some trouble conceptualizing the model of the game-state. Pac-man works with a grid system so it seems only intuitive that I use a 2D array to help with my modelling. Here's what I've managed to work out so far:\n",
      "1) I have a 2D array wherein each element in the array represented a piece of the game board. I'm thinking of filling the 2D array with ints such that each int represents something different within the gameboard environment (i.e. 0's represent a wall). \n",
      "\n",
      "2) I create a JPanel and set its layout to have the same dimensions as my 2D array. The JPanel will have access to my 2D array, so I will then loop through every element of the 2D array and will decide what to populate the next \"section\" of the JPanel grid with based on the int in the corresponding element of the 2D array. This distinction between the 2D array and the JPanel grid allows for the introduction of multiple levels if I so choose to implement that.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Here's where I get stuck: it seems intuitive to represent the walls and floor of the game board using ints in a 2D array, but I am unsure how to represent the location of my living objects (Pac-man and the ghosts). I am debating between a) representing, say, Pac-man as another int value in the 2D array, and b) having Pac-man be his own sub-type of the GameObj class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option b) seems more reasonable, but I am unsure how to represent the location of Pac-man if I were to implement him as an object. I can't simply rely on traditional x-y coordinates because Pac-man and the ghosts move in a quantized fashion. However, option a) seems unreasonable because it is easier to listen for arrow-key inputs and change Pac-man's position if he were an object instead of simply an int-value in a 2D array.\n",

      " Answer: Your intuition with the 2-D array and making Pac-man into its own object is definitely on the right track. You can have methods for Pac-man that move him 1 unit to the top / bottom / left / right based on the user key input. You can still use \"coordinates\" to represent the location of the Pac-man, like the [row][col] indices that he is in; the only downside to this is that pacman would move in \"jumps\" and not have \"continuous\" motion. Every time the user clicks on a key, you first move the pacman and then you could have a method inside where you keep track of the main game state to update the array with the new location of pacman (and set the original position back to \"default\" or \"eaten point\" or what you want that position to be). \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you could just NOT put pacman into the array, have him as another object that \"floats on top\" of the main game board (so that the array only contains the walls and foods) and then check for intersection with items in the array. This would allow you to make pacman have continuous motion, but might be more difficult to implement.\n",
